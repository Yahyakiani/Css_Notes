## Points to keep in mind why preparation
- Making Maps is quite important
- Its current affair part should not be attempted as current affairs but rather in context with US history.
- For MCQS: First one is Past Papers and 2nd is Important dates or topics while preparation.
-  pilgrimage movement. Independence, industrialisation , civil war. modern period
-  Check out the past papers since 2016, and you will notice that pre-columbian history of the native peoples is not a very important topic. Personally I skipped it entirely and saved myself some time. Do a very basic background of the first arrival of the whites, and the first British colonies (all 13) and then go into detail from 1740s onwards.
