### 18th & 19th Century
#### Main Notes
- **Identured servitude** Young men and women bound themselves to masters for fixed terms of servitude (usually four to five years) in exchange for passage to America, food, and shelter
- Adult persons bind 
themselves in writing to serve 3, 4, 5 or 6 
years for the amount due by on account of the passage
- When a husband or wife has died at 
sea, when the ship has made more than 
half of her trip, the survivor must pay or 
serve not only for himself or herself but 
also for the deceased.Same for children and their parents.
- American slavery—became legal in the early 
eighteenth century when colonial assemblies began to pass slave codes granting white 
masters almost absolute authority over their slaves. Only one factor determined whether 
a person was subject to the slave codes: color. In the colonial societies of Spanish America, 
people of mixed race were granted a different (and higher) status than pure Africans. 
English America recognized no such distinctions.
-  trade with England, 
continental Europe, and the west coast of Africa. This commerce has often been described, 
somewhat inaccurately, as **the triangular trade**.
