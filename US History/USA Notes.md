### 18th & 19th Century
#### Main Notes
- **Identured servitude** Young men and women bound themselves to masters for fixed terms of servitude (usually four to five years) in exchange for passage to America, food, and shelter
- Adult persons bind 
themselves in writing to serve 3, 4, 5 or 6 
years for the amount due by on account of the passage
- When a husband or wife has died at 
sea, when the ship has made more than 
half of her trip, the survivor must pay or 
serve not only for himself or herself but 
also for the deceased.Same for children and their parents.
- American slavery—became legal in the early 
eighteenth century when colonial assemblies began to pass slave codes granting white 
masters almost absolute authority over their slaves. Only one factor determined whether 
a person was subject to the slave codes: color. In the colonial societies of Spanish America, 
people of mixed race were granted a different (and higher) status than pure Africans. 
English America recognized no such distinctions.
-  trade with England, 
continental Europe, and the west coast of Africa. This commerce has often been described, 
somewhat inaccurately, as **the triangular trade**.

### COTTON, SLAVERY, AND THE OLD SOUTH   
#### Main Notes
- The traditional culture of the Southern United States has been called a "culture of honor", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a reputation for not accepting improper conduct by others.
- The Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that ladies should not be insulted by gentlemen. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be chivalrous toward women, in words and deeds
- The "culture of honor" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists[1] to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region. Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated South East England and East Anglia) who settled in New England, the Southern United States was settled by herders from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Northern England and the West Country.[2] Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft.
- James Henry Hammond, a U.S. senator from 
South Carolina, was a leading advocate for 
the overwhelming significance of cotton to 
the economy of the South and the nation. He 
famously made his point in 1858 in his 
“Cotton Is King” speech
