Does it ever happen to you that you take out your pen to write an essay, but the pen doesn’t move and you keep scratching your head because you do not know what to write?
Well, you are not alone in this. We all have to go through the writer's block. But what if I tell you that 99% of the content of your essay depends on the first sentence.

This first sentence is called by many names. But for the sake of convenience, I will call it the Thesis Statement.

What is the Thesis Statement?

The thesis statement is mostly the very first sentence that defines the course of your essay. It is the sentence on which the direction of your whole essay depends. It defines the purpose of writing the essay.

In simple words, it is the main idea of the essay. Your essay, whether argumentative of expository/factual, would be based on this.

But why do we even need to write the thesis statement?

One, it gives your essay a direction.

Two, it makes your essay focused, and gives weight to your argument.

Three, it gives the purpose to your essay.

Four, it makes it easier for the reader to grasp the message at the outset.

## Examples
Examples of the thesis statement:
1. Topic: Future of Democracy in Pakistan.
Thesis Statement: The democracy is bound to thrive in Pakistan if all the institutions operate within their constitutional limits, and the rule of law is respected.

2. Topic: Feminism is not really a third world issue. (CSS-2017)
Contrary to the belief that feminism is confined within the territorial jurisdiction of the underdeveloped nations, it is a universal phenomenon which advocates the equal social, political, legal and economic rights for women.

3. Does foreign aid help to achieve economic stability. (CSS-2016)
Foreign aid rarely helps to bring economic stability if it is not coupled with the reforms in the home economy such as securing property rights, improving tax culture, abolishing the culture of corruption, and improving the governance.

4. Brains, Like Hearts, Go Where They Are Appreciated.
Recently, the country has seen a significant number of skilled professionals from all walks of life leaving the country. The fundamental reason for this brain drain is the inability of the government to appreciate the potential value that they might add to the country.
Qualities of a strong thesis statement:

1. A strong thesis statement directly answers the hidden question asked in the topic.
For instance, in the 4th topic, there is a hidden question asked in the topic and that is: “Why is brain drain happening in Pakistan?” Therefore, your thesis statement should be able to answer the question asked in the topic.

2. Your thesis statement should not just state the facts. In fact, it should be based on the argument on which your essay has to revolve.

Look at the third topic. The thesis statement is not saying that foreign aid is defined as this or that and that this country got help from foreign funding and that did not. Rather, it picks up an argument on which the whole essay will be based.

3. The thesis statement should always be specific. You should always avoid taking a generalised approach to the thesis statement. The generalised approach makes your essay weak and loses the focus.

For instance, the first topic in the essay is very specific. It does not go into the history of democracy in Pakistan. Instead, it focuses solely on the future and gives the reasons thereof.

4. The Thesis statement should always be within the introduction. It can be placed anywhere, but mostly it is the first sentence.

The first three topics above had the first sentence as the thesis statement. However, the fourth sentence has the second sentence as the thesis statement. But, keep in mind that it would always be within the introductory paragraph.

So, in this post, I defined what a thesis statement is and I also gave you some examples of the thesis statement. In the next post, I will tell you how to write a thesis statement.

## 𝐇𝐎𝐖 𝐓𝐎 𝐆𝐄𝐍𝐄𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐄 𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐀𝐒 𝐅𝐎𝐑 𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐀𝐘
𝗕𝘆: 𝗗𝗿 𝗞𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗳 𝗞𝗵𝘂𝗵𝗿𝗼 

I have known a number of students who often go blank when they see the topic. To tell you the truth, I also have faced the issue at a number of occasions.

But, let me assure you that this problem can be overcome very easily. All you need is a little practice at thinking. In this post, I am going to tell you strategies to get the right ideas for any topic that you want to write on.

But first, remember that if you want your ideas to be powerful, you need to read a lot first. If you don’t have the habit of reading, you won’t be able to generate quality ideas.

There are a lot of strategies which people use to generate ideas for their essays. For instance, freewriting, brainstorming, mind-mapping and questioning.

All of these methods work, but they work differently for different people. Therefore, I would suggest you try each of these for yourself and once you find one of them to match your way, stick to it and improve it over time with consistent practice.
**Free Writing**
The first strategy is called Free-Writing. This can also be called mind-dumping since you get to write without stopping whatever that comes to your mind. In this strategy, you are not concerned with the correctness of the ideas, but the flow of ideas.
You should start by setting a timer of let’s say 10-15 minutes, and then keep writing stuff about the topic. Do not stop if you are stuck anywhere, write something that comes to mind, however irrelevant or non-sensical it might look. At the end of your time, you will surely find a few insights into the topic.
**Brainstorming**
The second strategy is called brainstorming. This strategy begins by thinking about the topic and then jotting down every single idea or a piece of information on the paper.
In this method, you should give yourself a time of 10-15 minutes and then think about every possible linkage that your topic might have with any other subject.
Let’s say the topic is about Democracy, then you should consider what sociologists, philosophers or political scientists have to say about it. Any quote that you remember, any democrats or examples of the countries where democracy is the form of governance would be handy.
You might also think about the differences, similarities, characteristics of democracy, their economies and institutions as well. Whatever that comes to mind, note it down on the paper. This is brainstorming.
**Mind-mapping**
The third strategy is called mind-mapping. In this strategy again, you start by allocating yourself a good amount of time; whatever that you consider sufficient. For me, 10-15 minutes should be the standard.
Once you have set the time, begin by writing the topic or the central theme on the centre of a blank page and then try to break it into smaller parts. Each smaller part should then be addressed separately. Keep the facts, figures, sub-ideas come until exhausted.
**Questioning**
The final strategy is the questioning trick. In this method, you ask yourself questions about the topic.
Who, What, How, When, Why are some of the questions you would normally resort to. This strategy, however, is not suitable since it covers only a few aspects of the topic.
So, my favourite one is mind-mapping. In my case, this is the best strategy as it allows you to address all the major parts of your essay in a very structured and efficient way.
I use brainstorming when I prepare the topics in advance and in group study sessions. Free-writing is time-consuming, so I do not usually follow that. As I said earlier, try all of them until you find one that works best for you.
But you can also use all of them simultaneously as well. Mixing them up will also help you generate good ideas.
**Some major points to keep in mind:**
Once you are done with idea generation sessions, please take your time to sort out the relevant and irrelevant things.
Please do not write everything you have jotted down already. Your ideas should have relevance, clarity, and must be coherence.
Remember, it is not the number of your ideas, but the quality that would make it stand out.
Also keep in mind that the quality of ideas improves with observing the world around you, discussing the ideas with others, reading the books and listening to others.
You should not expect yourself to come up with brilliant ideas without having read about them first.
Therefore, enhance your knowledge base, only then will you be able to generate good ideas.

## 𝐒𝐓𝐄𝐏 𝐁𝐘 𝐒𝐓𝐄𝐏 𝐆𝐔𝐈𝐃𝐄 𝐎𝐍 𝐖𝐑𝐈𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐀 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐒𝐈𝐒 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓
𝗗𝗿. 𝗞𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗳 𝗞𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗵𝗼 (𝗣𝗔𝗦, 𝗖𝗦𝗦-𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟮)
One of the important tasks while writing an essay is to construct a workable thesis statement. For long, I did not focus on the thesis statement and that is why I would produce vague and sub-standard essays.

But once I mastered the technique to write an effective thesis statement, I started writing essays worthy of appreciation. So before we delve deep into the thesis statement, let’s just understand what a thesis statement is.

In simple terms, the thesis statement is the main idea, the central argument or the position that you take in your essay. It comprises of one or two sentences and is put usually in the first few sentences of the essay.

For a detailed discussion on the Thesis Statement, you can check my previous post on it. Here is

[𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐒𝐈𝐒 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓By: Dr Kashif Khuhro… - Kashif’s CSS Blogs | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kashifcssblog/posts/126389245849037)
I would suggest you to read the post before going ahead.
Now, let’s start writing some awesome thesis statements step wise.

1. Pick a suitable topic.
The first step is to pick a nice topic on which you should have some sort of grip. From the given topics, choose the one you are most familiar with. The reason behind this is that the more familiar you are with a topic, the more material you will have and the more aspects of it you will be aware of.

For a detailed post on topic selection, read this:
[𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐅𝐈𝐕𝐄 𝐏𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐂𝐈𝐏𝐋𝐄𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐓𝐎𝐏𝐈𝐂 𝐒𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍… - Kashif’s CSS Blogs | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kashifcssblog/posts/110805930740702)
For this post, I will take **In the fight against terrorism and corruption, it is imperative not to compromise human rights and civil liberties. (CSS-2018)**

2. Analyse the topic:
Sometimes, out of haste, an aspirant just picks up the familiar topic and starts writing. I think this approach should be avoided. This is a compulsory paper and the whole premise of your essay is based on a thesis statement. Therefore, it would be better to take some time to let the topic sink in.

You should first analyse what material or arguments you have to support a particular claim.
For the topic I mentioned above, I will first see, whether I have enough material or arguments tell the reader that human rights are being violated and civil liberties are being curtailed in the name of war on terror?

Once I decided that I am going with the topic, and not against it, I will start gathering evidence by brainstorming on it.

- Afghanistan, people dying, and imprisoned. Check
- Destruction of infrastructure to provide basic necessities of life, check
- Pakistan, drone attacks. Check
- Abu Gharib jail, people imprisoned. Check
- Afia Siddiqui, violation of human rights, check.
- Surveillance by security agencies such as NSA in America and PTA in Pakistan, Check
- Forced Disappearances in Pakistan, check
- Killing of people in Kashmir by Indian Army, Check
- Intervention of Armed Forces in the name of National Action Plan causes curtailing of civil liberties, Check
- NAB laws, death of the professor, and incarceration of people without trial, check
- Media trials curtail civil liberties, check
- Political victimisation in the name of corruption, check
- FATF and blackmailing of the developing world economies, check

This is enough to generate a good thesis statement.

3. Now, I would try to frame a thesis statement in one or two sentences. In this statement, I would not give a list of arguments, or agreement or disagreement. Rather, I would limit the scope of my discussion to the argument I put forward.

For instance, in this thesis statement, I can pick any one of the following arguments.

a. The war on terror and corruption has caused severe human rights violations and curtailing of civil liberties, both of which undermine sanctity of human life and freedom specially in the developing and underdeveloped countries.

b. Although war on terror and corruption has been the cause of concern, but in the larger interests of the nations, it is very necessary to keep the fight on so that the menace of terrorism and corruption can be done away with.
You can take any of the options you like. For me, I can twist both of them in my favour. 🙃
Although I would suggest you to pick a statement like “a” for exam. Even I would pick “a” for exam.

4. Always keep your thesis statement prominent in your introduction. Your introduction needs to be specific and narrow. In my opinion, general introductions do not prove as much effective, since the reader does not hook on to the introduction instantaneously.
Some aspirants include the thesis statement in the outline of the essay as well, although this practice does not guarantee getting good marks. You can choose to put it in the outline, or you may not. It is up to you.

5. Anticipate the counter-arguments:
One of the best ways to elongate your essay quality-wise is to anticipate the counter-arguments and then building the paragraphs on the answers.

For instance, if I take the thesis statement “a”, then I should anticipate following questions.
Should war on terror be discontinued?
Should the corrupt not be put behind jail?
Should the world tolerate the terrorists?

The developed world would try its best to protect its national interests.

Majority of those who are in jails like Abu Gharib are hardened criminals.
If the government scrapped the corruption watchdogs, who will put a break on corrupt practices?

If ending corruption is the key to progress, then we should ignore the victimisation for the time being.

Violation of human rights of only the terrorists, not the common people. They are not being harassed anywhere.

If you take topic “b”, you can expect counter-arguments contrary to the list above.
Once you anticipate the questions, you can make a stunning outline out of these arguments.
——————————————————————————
A few more things about Thesis Statement.
A thesis statement is not:

1. A list of arguments. I did not mention any of the violations or curtailments in my thesis statement.

2. Vague or broad. Be as specific as possible.

3. Inarguable. The arguments you put should be logical and could be subject to discussion.

4. Agreement or disagreement. Do not start your thesis with sentence like “I agree with the topic because” or “I disagree with the topic because”.
——————————————————————————————————————————
A little exercise here. Try to write a thesis statement on any of the following three topics.
Classrooms decide the future of the nation (CSS-2019)
Labor saving devices are more troublesome than they worth (CSS-2015)
Being minority is a fate no one wants. Can nationalism be really inclusive? (CSS-2017)
Write your thesis statement in the comment box.
