superEGo:

Bipolar Disorder: Extreme change in emotions from sadness to exhiliration.From calmness to rage.
Schizophrenia: Inconsistant though process.Do have insight on their own behaviour. Cannot distinguish between reality and illusion.

Behavioral Theory: An individual learns criminal behaviour from his surrounding.Society makes people criminals.
Cognitive Theory: A persons perception how he registers emotions and information and how it is manifested in the real world determines his
propensity to commit crime.


Intelligence and Crime: Sort of Nature vs Nurture debate. Studies have shown that 40% deliquent male offenders have below average iqs based on tests
conducted in late 20th century.


Social Theory: Part of Behavioral Theory:  Criminals learn about crime through their surroundings which enforces such behavior on them.

Three mechanisms through which individuals learn to engage in crime:
Differential Reinforcement:
Beliefs:
Modeling: Aspiring to be someone who is a criminal.The troupe of robin hood is a classical example of this mechanisms.It states to steal from the
rich and give it to the poor.


Positive Reinforcement: Acquisition of something rewarding.Approval,money,social Status,pleasure etc.
Negative Reinforcement: Removal of something bad.Punishment is avoided.


Labeling Theory: Its is associated with the reaction of public and institutions to a crime who then label the individuals in different catogeries
which influences their behaviour. It can also work on the principle of self fulfilling prophecy.Such labelization can exacerbate the
situation as well.

Its was given by howard becker in 1963.

Infamous standford prison experiment is a famous example of this theory. Where prisoners accepted their labels acted submissively .The guards took
their labels even more seriously and took to brutalizing prisoners in an effort to dominate them and fulfill their role.

Reactions which leads to labeling  is done by 3 major sectors:

informal group: Friends,family or spouses.
Institutions such as crime justice system which reacts to the crime in some manner.
Third, are the people who see the act as a threat and perform legislation against it.


strain Theory: Society has some cultural goals that must be achieved. Often the means to achieve these goals are not sufficient and so
strain is produced within the society.

Accept both the goals and the means available to achieve them. Conformity
Accept the goal but reject the means.
Reject the goals but make use of the means.
Reject both the goals and the means.  Rebellion

Belief: Either Individual denys the whole belief system or he rationalizes his belief in such a way that he can still commit a crime and conside it wrong.
Involvement: Individuals whole involved in the cycle of daily life do not have time for deviance or crime.

Etiology(Origin)

Criminal Justice Refers to study of agencies of social control such as courts,police and corrections.

=====================================================================================================

Classical Criminology:

18th Century.

Cesare Baccaria agreed with the views of social Philosopher Benham that Individuals act based on rational thought process.They act on the
principle of maximizing Pleasure and reducing pain.


Basic Elements of Classical Criminology:

- Individuals have free will and they can choose whether to commit a crime or not.
- Commiting a crime can be attractive because it can requires little effort for a huge payoff.
- A person wil not choose to commit a crime only if he believes that pain of expected punishment will exceed the pleasure.This is called principle of deterence.
- Punishment should be swift  and harsh so that criminals can understand that "crime does not pay."


Criminal commit crimes because with little effort a lot of profit can be gained.





=====================================================================================================
19th Century

Elements of the Scientiﬁ c Method
Observation Identify problem and collect data and facts
Hypothesis Develop a reasonable explanation to account for or predict the data observed and the facts collected Test
Hypothesis Test hypothesis using control groups and experimental methods
Interpretation Analyze data using accepted statistical techniques
Conclusion Interpret data and verify or disprove accuracy of hypothesis


Auguste Comte applied scientific principle to criminology.


August described evolution of society in 2 steps in their observation:
 First primitive societies considered inanimate objects to be alive.Such as " Sun is God" in the Persian society.

 Then there were Societies which have evolved to consider things through scientific method . Comte called this final stage as the positive stage.
 Those who followed comte's views were called positivists.

positivism has two main elements:
❚   All true knowledge is acquired through direct observation and not through conjecture or belief. Statements that cannot be backed up by direct observation—for instance, “all babies are born innocent”— are invalid and worthless.
❚   The scientiﬁ c method must be used if research ﬁndings are to be considered valid. This involves such steps as identifying problems, collecting data, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, and interpreting results



Biological Positivists: Those who applied scientific principles to biology to diffentiate criminals from normal honest citizens.
Cesare

Biological Theory: it can be traced to cesare lombroso.He working a doctor in the italian army.According to him criminals have distinct
physical features from non-criminals.He studied the length between first and second toes for both and found that criminals had on average 3 mm
greater distance between toes.
-Lombroso also showed pictures of criminals and non-criminals to young  girls for identification.The objective being to seperate them
based solely on facial features.
In his study he found that these girls could identify criminals with greater accuracy.

-Lombroso Stated that repeat offenders of physical assualt of stealing inherited primitive physical charactistics.These characteristic
he defineds as atavistic characteristics. These could be inherited from either a criminal parent genetically or through mentally ill ancestors.

-His greatest critic charles goring refuted this research by conducting a similar experiment and denoting that such is not the case.

Social Positivists: Those who used sociological data and statistic to understand its relationship with crime.Such as age,sex,poverty even weather.

Quetelet studied data gathered in France to investigate the inﬂuence of social factors on the propensity to commit crime
 In addition to ﬁ nding a strong inﬂ uence of age and sex on crime, Quetelet also uncovered evidence that season, climate,
population composition, and poverty were related to criminality.

Adolphe Quetlet Instigated the use of data and statistics in criminological research.
Émile Durkheim defined crime as normal and necessary social event.As long as human differences exist, then, crime is inevitable and one of the fundamental conditions of social life.
The shift from rural to urban life produce anomie or role confusion in society driving crime.
=====================================================================================================

Chicago school and Beyond
- Social Ecology is formed in an urban city.Some areas are affluent and some are extremely poor which are crime hotbeds.These poor
conditions create social disorganization which leads to crime.
- Criminal behaviour is likely linked to enviromental conditions.


=====================================================================================================

Social Psychological Views.
 Unstable homes or insufficient education system can lead individuals towards deviant peers.In this socialization is the main driving force
 in crime.
- Edward sutherland states that criminal attitude is a learned behaviour from older more experience peers.
- Walter Reckless states that crime occurs when children have inadequate self image rendering them incapable of controlling their misbehaviour.


- Karl Marx -- The most important relationship in industrial culture is between the owners of the means of production—the capitalist bourgeoisie—and the people who do the actual labor, the proletariat. The economic system controls all facets of human life; consequently, people’s lives revolve around the means of production. The exploitation of the working class, he believed, would eventually lead to class conﬂ ict and the end of the capitalist system.

- Developmental Criminology: A mixture of Sociology,Psychology and biology. Early Deliquency is the harbinger of criminal behaviour.
 Relationships with parents is the most important factor in determining the propensity towards crime.
- Developmental models track the natural history of a criminal career.

=====================================================================================================

Criminologists also conduct research on relationship between different types of crimes.This is called crime topology.
=====================================================================================================
The study of penology involves correction and control of criminal offenders.it is a segment of criminology that overlaps
with criminal justice in order to determine their effectiveness and impact.For example should capital punishment be continued.
=====================================================================================================
Juvenile Deliquency: It can be described as breaking of law by someone who under the legal age.
2 types of Juvenile delinquents:

Age-specific delinquents: They do not persist in criminal behaviour after passing into adulthood.Prosection is lenient.They are never incarcerated for their first offense.

Status offenders: Status offenders are those offenders who would not be considered criminal if they were adults. Status offense related crime
can be beyond parental control,possession or consumption of alcohol or drugs,running away from home and not attending school.
Status offenders are also called "Youth in crisis".

Repeat offenders: Repeat offenders are also called 'life-long persistant offenders'.These type of juvenile deliquents persist in criminal
activity even after they become adults. Prosections for repeat offenders is harsher and in some cases it is handled by adult courts.

- Criminal Investigation is an applied science that is used to locate ,identify and prove the guilt of accused criminal.Criminal investigation can involve searching,interviews,interrogations,evidence collection and various methods of investegations.

- Principles of Investigation:
& Exercising of legal powers should not be oppressive and should be commensurate with the gravity of the crime.
& Investigation should be as transparent as possible.Victims and other parties should be kept upto speed with the investigation as much as appropriate.
& Investigators should have special regard for vulnerable individuals and children.
& Investigators should have a professional regard for others.
& Investigators should take reasonable steps to understand the need of individuals during investigation
& Confidentialy: THis means preventing the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information related to the crime.
$ Accuracy: Collection of complete and clear data which is either incriminating or exculpatory.


- Volumn crime: Crime which with sheer volumn has the ability to impact the a community and the ability of police to tackle that crime. street robbery,mobile snatching, car stealing etc.
- serious crime: A crime which involves sufficient use of violence and results in substantial financial gains or conducted by a large number of personnel in pursuit of similar goal.
- Modus operandi: A term used by law enforcement to describe how a specific crime was conducted.
How modus operandi can help in investigation:
& It can help predict future patterns of crime so that they can prevented and cautionary measures can be taken against those crime.
& Link a crime to a series of crime to understand whether crime is being commited by same offenders or not.S
& Link a crime to a similar set of crimes to understand criminal behaviour in particular catogery.
& It helps in generating a criminal profile for the offender so that the investigative authorities can limited their search to certain charactistics.
& Understand how a crime has been particularly been commited.
& Identify likely disposal routes of evidence or other illicit property.
-
- Circumstantial Evidence: THis can be described as evidence of circumstance surrounding the offense or an event that could be used to infer facts.E.g  Such as a finger print on a scene  of crime.

Perliminary Investigation: The primary objective of perliminary investigation is to determine who commited the crime and apprehend the offender.it involves the steps of :
- Determining the offender
- Identification of victim, the time of crime and the place of crime.
- Identification of solvability factors
- Communication about the details of the crime
- Identification of those tasks that are done and those yet to be done.

Solvability factors:
- Witness to a crime
- Suspects name
- Mode of operation in crime
- Evidence from crime scene
- Description of suspect
- Identification of suspect
- Place or location where the suspect might be located
- Car used by the suspect
- Belief whether the crime can be solved by publicity
- Property with identifiable characteristics

Intelligence Operation: Intelligence operation is through which military groups,governments and bussinesses collect and evaluate information to understand the capabilities and intentions of rival parties.

Tradecraft: Is the term used to describe methods,practices and techniques used involving spying and secret investigation activities.

Intelligence gather from covert operations falls into 3 catogeries:

- Human Intelligence: Intelligence gather by and about humans to interpret the intention of the adversary. Commander Gulbhusan Yadav is an example of human intelligence gather.

- Signals Intelligence: Interception of Electronic emission and other types of signals for gather intelligence.Such as wire tapping,radar hijacking. Berlin tunnel was a large scale wire tapping operation.

- Photographic Intelligence: Photographic data collection through diffenet means such as reconaissance drones which can gather photographic data as well as thermography along with other advanced radars for such means.

Computer Forensics: Is collection and analysis of digital data to be used in legal,civil or administrative cases.
E.g Finding user computer activity,Network activity,Chat data etc.

Principles of DataBase Investigation:
1. Ensure that data entered into a database is not and cannot be changed or manipulated that can undermine its legal and investigative value.Incase this data is presented in the court in future.

2. Individual handling database investigation should be competent enough in handling database related operations.ALong with having a clear and concise understand of data.So, that he can provide a thorough explaination and relevance of this data in court.

3. A well documented and audited trail must be kept in all the database investigative process so that a third party can verify the results following the same steps.

4. Person leading the investigation must have all the responsibility related to database operations in making sure that all the laws and legal steps have been adhered to.

Model Of data Base Investigation: It is to identify,document and analyze data to find the root cause so that appropriate recommendations or solutions can be provided.


=====================================================================================================
# Electronic Investigation

Electronic Investigation refers to the scientific study of electronic devices for the purpose of extracting data that can be as evidence for proving of culpability.

It can involve information about who made a certain document,when was it last edited,Who opened it last time etc.

Basic methodology involves 3 steps:
- Detection of intrusion in the system
- Evaluating threat and vulnerabilities
- Forensic investigation on the data

Steps Involving Electronic Investigation:
- Identification of Evidence
- Presevation of Evidence
- Extraction of the Evidence
- Analyzing and interpretation of the evidence
- Presentation of Evidence in court
=====================================================================================================

# Forensic Investigation

Forensic Investigation is the use of science and technology in investigation and analysis of evidence to be used in criminal justice system.Such using hair for DNA match up to infer the presence of a suspect in a specific location.

Evidence such as hair ,Coat fibre, printed material found at the scene of crime which can help in determining the offender is called
trace evidence. Digital evidence such as IP address logs and search history also fall under this catogery.

Types of Evidence:
Biological Evidence: Includes blood and saliva
Drug Evidence: Can include marijuana,cocaine and other controlled substances.
Trace Evidence: Can include hair,synthetic fibre,electronic Printed data etc.
Print Evidence: It can include boot prints, car tyre impression etc
Digital Evidence: Trace logs,IP address logs, Search History etc.
Weapon Evidence: Can include types of ballistics, Weapons etc
Finger Print Evidence: can include fingerprint  of all 10 fingers.

=====================================================================================================
# Techniques of Investigation

- Two general methods of investigation:
- Accusatorial
- Information Gathering

Properties of Investigation Process:
# -1  RelationShip with the Suspect

Information Gathering: Building a positive rapport with the suspect and obtain a confession through positive confrontation.
Accusatorial: Confronting the suspect and obtaining a confession through manipulation and coercion.

# -2  Questioning Approach
 IG- Open Ended question to allow the suspect to clarify and provide his side of story

 A- Closed Ended and Accusatory Questions

# -3  Primary Intended Outcome
IG- Allow the suspect to provide a defense for himself

A- Obtain a Confession from the suspect

# -4  Model of the Outcome

IG - Cognitive Cues ( Can a suspect recount events in a different order)
A  - Anxiety based-Cues (e.g is the suspect nervous ?)


# Interrogation Techniques:

Reid Method:

Reid Method follows 3 basic steps:
