# Psychological Theories:

- Psychodynamic Theory: A persons childhood experience influences his likelihood of commiting crime in the future. Given by sigmund freud.
- id: Animalistic drives for food ,sex and other necessities. Wants instant gratification.
- Ego: It develops in early childhood of a human.
superEGo:

- Bipolar Disorder: Extreme change in emotions from sadness to exhiliration.From calmness to rage.
Schizophrenia: Inconsistant though process.Do have insight on their own behaviour. Cannot distinguish between reality and illusion.

- Behavioral Theory: An individual learns criminal behaviour from his surrounding.Society makes people criminals.
Cognitive Theory: A persons perception how he registers emotions and information and how it is manifested in the real world determines his propensity to commit crime.

# Intelligence and Crime

- Intelligence and Crime: Sort of Nature vs Nurture debate. Studies have shown that 40% deliquent male offenders have below average iqs based on tests conducted in late 20th century.

- Travis Hirschi and Michael Hindelang concluded that low intelligence is an important causal factor in delinquent behavior, independent of social class and race, although the relationship is primarily indirect.


- youths with low IQs do poorly in school, and poor school performance leads to frustration and anger and subsequently to delinquent behavior

- Low IQ contributes to delinquency by inhibiting school performance, decreasing the development of self-control (sometimes called inhibitory deficits

- Social Theory: Part of Behavioral Theory:  Criminals learn about crime through their surroundings which enforces such behavior on them.

Three mechanisms through which individuals learn to engage in crime:
- Differential Reinforcement:
- Beliefs:
- Modeling: Aspiring to be someone who is a criminal.The troupe of robin hood is a classical example of this mechanisms.It states to steal from the rich and give it to the poor.


- Positive Reinforcement: Acquisition of something rewarding.Approval,money,social Status,pleasure etc.
- Negative Reinforcement: Removal of something bad.Punishment is avoided.

# Labeling Theory

- Labeling Theory: Its is associated with the reaction of public and institutions to a crime who then label the individuals in different catogeries which influences their behaviour. It can also work on the principle of self fulfilling prophecy.Such labelization can exacerbate the situation as well.

Its was given by howard becker in 1963.

- Infamous standford prison experiment is a famous example of this theory. Where prisoners accepted their labels acted submissively .The guards took their labels even more seriously and took to brutalizing prisoners in an effort to dominate them and fulfill their role.

Reactions which leads to labeling  is done by 3 major sectors:

informal group: Friends,family or spouses.
Institutions such as crime justice system which reacts to the crime in some manner.
Third, are the people who see the act as a threat and perform legislation against it.


- strain Theory: Society has some cultural goals that must be achieved. Often the means to achieve these goals are not sufficient and so
strain is produced within the society.


Individuals React in 4 ways to these goals:
1. Accept both the goals and the means available to achieve them. Conformity
2. Accept the goal but reject the means.
3. Reject the goals but make use of the means.
4. Reject both the goals and the means.  Rebellion

- Social Control theory: Criminal engage in criminal behaviour due to breakage of societal bonds.These bond are depended  upon 4 factors:

1. Commitment: Individuals adhere to the law for fear of punishment or retribution.
2. Attachment: Relations with close family and friends determine his propensity to commit a crime or indulge in deviant behaviour.
3. Belief: Either Individual denys the whole belief system or he rationalizes his belief in such a way that he can still commit a crime and conside it wrong.
4. Involvement: Individuals whole involved in the cycle of daily life do not have time for deviance or crime.

Etiology(Origin)

- Criminal Justice Refers to study of agencies of social control such as courts,police and corrections.

# Classical Criminology

18th Century.

Cesare Baccaria agreed with the views of social Philosopher Benham that Individuals act based on rational thought process.They act on the
principle of maximizing Pleasure and reducing pain.


Basic Elements of Classical Criminology:

- Individuals have free will and they can choose whether to commit a crime or not.
- Commiting a crime can be attractive because it can requires little effort for a huge payoff.
- A person wil not choose to commit a crime only if he believes that pain of expected punishment will exceed the pleasure.This is called principle of deterence.
- Punishment should be swift  and harsh so that criminals can understand that "crime does not pay."


Criminal commit crimes because with little effort a lot of profit can be gained.





# 19th Century

Elements of the Scientiﬁ c Method
Observation Identify problem and collect data and facts
Hypothesis Develop a reasonable explanation to account for or predict the data observed and the facts collected Test
Hypothesis Test hypothesis using control groups and experimental methods
Interpretation Analyze data using accepted statistical techniques
Conclusion Interpret data and verify or disprove accuracy of hypothesis


- Auguste Comte applied scientific principle to criminology.


August described evolution of society in 2 steps in their observation:
 - First primitive societies considered inanimate objects to be alive.Such as " Sun is God" in the Persian society.

 - Then there were Societies which have evolved to consider things through scientific method . Comte called this final stage as the positive stage.
 - Those who followed comte's views were called positivists.

positivism has two main elements:
❚   All true knowledge is acquired through direct observation and not through conjecture or belief. Statements that cannot be backed up by direct observation—for instance, “all babies are born innocent”— are invalid and worthless.
❚   The scientiﬁ c method must be used if research ﬁndings are to be considered valid. This involves such steps as identifying problems, collecting data, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, and interpreting results



- Biological Positivists: Those who applied scientific principles to biology to diffentiate criminals from normal honest citizens.

Cesare

- Biological Theory: it can be traced to cesare lombroso.He working a doctor in the italian army.According to him criminals have distinct physical features from non-criminals.He studied the length between first and second toes for both and found that criminals had on average 3 mm greater distance between toes.

- Lombroso observed that criminals displayed distinctive physical characteristics, called stigmata, which resembled “savages” and lower animals. Criminal stigmata, according to Lombroso, included asymmetry of the face, large jaws and
cheekbones, unusually large or small ears that stand out from the head, fleshy lips,

- Lombroso also showed pictures of criminals and non-criminals to young  girls for identification.The objective being to seperate them based solely on facial features.

- This is an idea of born criminal type and cesare lombroso never abandoned it.

In his study he found that these girls could identify criminals with greater accuracy.

- Lombroso Stated that repeat offenders of physical assualt of stealing inherited primitive physical charactistics.These characteristic he defineds as atavistic characteristics. These could be inherited from either a criminal parent genetically or through mentally ill ancestors.

- His greatest critic charles goring refuted this research by conducting a similar experiment and denoting that such is not the case.

- Social Positivists: Those who used sociological data and statistic to understand its relationship with crime.Such as age,sex,poverty even weather.

Quetelet studied data gathered in France to investigate the inﬂuence of social factors on the propensity to commit crime. In addition to ﬁnding a strong inﬂuence of age and sex on crime, Quetelet also uncovered evidence that season, climate, population composition, and poverty were related to criminality.

- Adolphe Quetlet Instigated the use of data and statistics in criminological research.
- Émile Durkheim defined crime as normal and necessary social event.As long as human differences exist, then, crime is inevitable and one of the fundamental conditions of social life.
- The shift from rural to urban life produce anomie or role confusion in society driving crime.
=====================================================================================================

# Chicago school and Beyond
- Social Ecology is formed in an urban city.Some areas are affluent and some are extremely poor which are crime hotbeds.These poor
conditions create social disorganization which leads to crime.
- Criminal behaviour is likely linked to enviromental conditions.

# Nature vs Nuture

- It is an outdated argument that only one aspect drives delinquint or anti-social behaviour.Such is not the case and with development of biosocial theory.Nature vs nuture has been over taken by nature-nuture interaction theory.

- While biological and environmental characteristics and conditions are powerful predictors of antisocial
behavior, they are not causal in a deterministic sense. Rather, they are probabilistic, increasing the likelihood
or “risk” of antisocial behavior. Antisocial behavior is not an inevitable outcome, but youths who are
predisposed by virtue of their biological makeup and who are exposed to an adverse environment are at greater
risk

- Key biological influences on antisocial behavior can be categorized into three areas of study:
(1) neurological deficits,
(2) biochemical factors,
(3) heredity and behavioral genetics

1. Neurological Deficits
-  In particular, “deficits in the prefrontal cortex may reduce the executive function.impulse control,behaviour

2. autonomic system underarousal

- Research has shown that the physiological condition of autonomic system underarousal is related to antisocial, criminal, and violent behavior in both children and adults. The most common measure of autonomic underarousal is low resting heart rate.

- Stimulation-seeking theory

- Fearlessness theory

- Reduced right hemisphere functioning Theory

- Testosterone

3. heredity and behavioral genetics

- Genetic factors refer to traits and characteristics that are handed down from parent to child, based on the influence of genes. The measure of this genetic influence is called heritability

- crime runs in families

- the study of behavioral genetics seeks to “estimate the relative contributions of heredity and environment” on individual traits, such as impulsivity, aggressiveness, and negativity.


# Extra Points

- most famous adoption study of antisocial behavior used data from an extensive Danish Adoption
Register.showed that rates of court convictions were higher for male adoptees when their biological parents were convicted and vice versa.
=====================================================================================================




# Social Psychological Views.
 Unstable homes or insufficient education system can lead individuals towards deviant peers.In this socialization is the main driving force
 in crime.
- Edward sutherland states that criminal attitude is a learned behaviour from older more experience peers.
- Walter Reckless states that crime occurs when children have inadequate self image rendering them incapable of controlling their misbehaviour.


- Karl Marx -- The most important relationship in industrial culture is between the owners of the means of production—the capitalist bourgeoisie—and the people who do the actual labor, the proletariat. The economic system controls all facets of human life; consequently, people’s lives revolve around the means of production. The exploitation of the working class, he believed, would eventually lead to class conﬂ ict and the end of the capitalist system.

- Developmental Criminology: A mixture of Sociology,Psychology and biology. Early Deliquency is the harbinger of criminal behaviour.
 Relationships with parents is the most important factor in determining the propensity towards crime.
- Developmental models track the natural history of a criminal career.


- Criminologists also conduct research on relationship between different types of crimes.This is called crime topology.

=====================================================================================================

The study of penology involves correction and control of criminal offenders.it is a segment of criminology that overlaps
with criminal justice in order to determine their effectiveness and impact.For example should capital punishment be continued.

=====================================================================================================
# Juvenile Deliquency
Juvenile Deliquency: It can be described as breaking of law by someone who under the legal age.
2 types of Juvenile delinquents:

- Age-specific delinquents: They do not persist in criminal behaviour after passing into adulthood.Prosection is lenient.They are never incarcerated for their first offense.

- Status offenders: Status offenders are those offenders who would not be considered criminal if they were adults. Status offense related crime can be beyond parental control,possession or consumption of alcohol or drugs,running away from home and not attending school.

- Status offenders are also called "Youth in crisis".

- Repeat offenders: Repeat offenders are also called 'life-long persistant offenders'.These type of juvenile deliquents persist in criminal activity even after they become adults. Prosections for repeat offenders is harsher and in some cases it is handled by adult courts.
=====================================================================================================
# Police

Police is the enforcing arm of the state.
Purpose of police is to enforce law, protect life and property and keep the peace.
Juvenile Justice system mirros the adult system for criminal justice. Similar to It it has 3 basic componenets:
courts,correctional institutes and police.

Principles on which police operates in juvenile justice system:
- Help in enforcement of law
-To support law enforcement leader to take on a leading role in formulating laws and act as agents of change in the communities.

# Important Aspects of police role for juvenile justice system:
- (Principle: Handle,Investigate,decide,deal)

- Court Referals: Polices decides on the merits on which cases to refer to juvenile justice system or not. High cases referred are by police then correctional officers and parents.

- Protection services: Police are the first responders in case of crisis.In case of general mayhem police arrive first on the scene to control the situation and protect the public.E.g In case a toddler has been left alone in the mall.

- Education: Police collaborates with Educational institutions for educating the minors and often police officers go to the schools and colleges for demonstration and presentations. They keep tabs on individuals who might be a danger to society and bring him in case deemed necessary.

- Alternative Routes:Police can often decide to deal with offenders in different manners .Such as letting a status offender off with a warning.
Most of such cases dont  reach the court.

- Status Offenses: Police often handle status offenses and they also intervene in non-delinquint cases .Such as individuals who have been missing in regards to school.They investigate these matters
=====================================================================================================
# Juvenile Courts

Juvenile Courts: Courts responsible for the trial and legal supervision of minors in a state.
Procedure of Court:

3. The child shall be kept seperate from adult population in case of conviction.
4. Every child shall have regular contact with his guardian or parents .
5. Juvenile offenders must be given education and taught necessary skills by the states.So, that they can later be reintegrated in the society.
6. Alternative to correctional institutes, the state shall provide a course of action for the juvenile offenders rehabilition.

=====================================================================================================
# Role of Prosecuter:
- Outside the Court room: Meeting with community leaders and education them about crime.Collaborating with youth serving agencies and communities.

In terms of prevention, raising awareness,importance of education, impact of substance abuse,
Early intervention to prevent juvenile offenses in schools and communities.
Diverting resources to observe serious repeat offenders instead of wasting resources on status offenders.

- Inside the court: Protecting the communities from dangerous juvenile offenders through detention.
Education and facilities provided by the state to juveniles in correctional institutes.
=====================================================================================================
# Defense Council

Defense Council: To educate the judges ,prosecutors,probation offices about the importance of expressed interests of their clients in court.
Attorney Client relationship.

Best interest of client is different from expressed interest of client.
Juvenile Delinquency attorney client relationship mirrors adult criminal attorney client relationship.

Defense council allows his client to become to the greatest extent possible the primary decision maker .

=====================================================================================================
- Juvenile judge has to have at least an understanding of adolescent development family dynamics,understanding of psychology,educational theory, traumatic abuse(mental,physical and social),cultural characteristics and organizational psychology.All wrapped in an attitude of temperance and empathy.
=====================================================================================================

Juvenile probation officers are responsible for supervising and observing juvenile offenders who are on parole or probation.

As of 1 april 2014 ,Adolescent Criminal Law.Minors aged from 16 to 22 can be tried under adult law depending upon the gravity of their crimes.


=====================================================================================================

# Criminal Investigation

- Criminal Investigation is an applied science that is used to locate ,identify and prove the guilt of accused criminal.Criminal investigation can involve searching,interviews,interrogations,evidence collection and various methods of investegations.

- Principles of Investigation:
& Exercising of legal powers should not be oppressive and should be commensurate with the gravity of the crime.
& Investigation should be as transparent as possible.Victims and other parties should be kept upto speed with the investigation as much as appropriate.
& Investigators should have special regard for vulnerable individuals and children.
& Investigators should have a professional regard for others.
& Investigators should take reasonable steps to understand the need of individuals during investigation
& Confidentialy: THis means preventing the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information related to the crime.
$ Accuracy: Collection of complete and clear data which is either incriminating or exculpatory.


- Volumn crime: Crime which with sheer volumn has the ability to impact the a community and the ability of police to tackle that crime. street robbery,mobile snatching, car stealing etc.
- serious crime: A crime which involves sufficient use of violence and results in substantial financial gains or conducted by a large number of personnel in pursuit of similar goal.
- Modus operandi: A term used by law enforcement to describe how a specific crime was conducted.
How modus operandi can help in investigation:
& It can help predict future patterns of crime so that they can prevented and cautionary measures can be taken against those crime.
& Link a crime to a series of crime to understand whether crime is being commited by same offenders or not.S
& Link a crime to a similar set of crimes to understand criminal behaviour in particular catogery.
& It helps in generating a criminal profile for the offender so that the investigative authorities can limited their search to certain charactistics.
& Understand how a crime has been particularly been commited.
& Identify likely disposal routes of evidence or other illicit property.


- Circumstantial Evidence: THis can be described as evidence of circumstance surrounding the offense or an event that could be used to infer facts.E.g  Such as a finger print on a scene  of crime.

Perliminary Investigation: The primary objective of perliminary investigation is to determine who commited the crime and apprehend the offender.it involves the steps of :
- Determining the offender
- Identification of victim, the time of crime and the place of crime.
- Identification of solvability factors
- Communication about the details of the crime
- Identification of those tasks that are done and those yet to be done.

Solvability factors:
- Witness to a crime
- Suspects name
- Mode of operation in crime
- Evidence from crime scene
- Description of suspect
- Identification of suspect
- Place or location where the suspect might be located
- Car used by the suspect
- Belief whether the crime can be solved by publicity
- Property with identifiable characteristics

- Intelligence Operation: Intelligence operation is through which military groups,governments and bussinesses collect and evaluate information to understand the capabilities and intentions of rival parties.

- Tradecraft: Is the term used to describe methods,practices and techniques used involving spying and secret investigation activities.

- Political Intelligence: Intelligence gathered about political rivals.

- Industrial Intelligence: Intelligence gather about rival companies or corporations.
Strategic or National Intelligence: Intelligence gather by intelligence agencies about rival nations.THis includes economic,political and nation security data about the opponent nation.

Covert operations: Are aimed at disruption intelligence activities of rivals.Through propoganda,disruption of information, assassination and encouraging dissident elements.

Intelligence gather from covert operations falls into 3 catogeries:

- Human Intelligence: Intelligence gather by and about humans to interpret the intention of the adversary. Commander Gulbhusan Yadav is an example of human intelligence gather.

- Signals Intelligence: Interception of Electronic emission and other types of signals for gather intelligence.Such as wire tapping,radar hijacking. Berlin tunnel was a large scale wire tapping operation.

- Photographic Intelligence: Photographic data collection through diffenet means such as reconaissance drones which can gather photographic data as well as thermography along with other advanced radars for such means.

Computer Forensics: Is collection and analysis of digital data to be used in legal,civil or administrative cases.
E.g Finding user computer activity,Network activity,Chat data etc.

Principles of DataBase Investigation:
1. Ensure that data entered into a database is not and cannot be changed or manipulated that can undermine its legal and investigative value.Incase this data is presented in the court in future.

2. Individual handling database investigation should be competent enough in handling database related operations.ALong with having a clear and concise understand of data.So, that he can provide a thorough explaination and relevance of this data in court.

3. A well documented and audited trail must be kept in all the database investigative process so that a third party can verify the results following the same steps.

4. Person leading the investigation must have all the responsibility related to database operations in making sure that all the laws and legal steps have been adhered to.

Model Of data Base Investigation: It is to identify,document and analyze data to find the root cause so that appropriate recommendations or solutions can be provided.


=====================================================================================================
# Electronic Investigation

Electronic Investigation refers to the scientific study of electronic devices for the purpose of extracting data that can be as evidence for proving of culpability.

It can involve information about who made a certain document,when was it last edited,Who opened it last time etc.

Basic methodology involves 3 steps:
- Detection of intrusion in the system
- Evaluating threat and vulnerabilities
- Forensic investigation on the data

Steps Involving Electronic Investigation:
- Identification of Evidence
- Presevation of Evidence
- Extraction of the Evidence
- Analyzing and interpretation of the evidence
- Presentation of Evidence in court
=====================================================================================================

# Forensic Investigation

Forensic Investigation is the use of science and technology in investigation and analysis of evidence to be used in criminal justice system.Such using hair for DNA match up to infer the presence of a suspect in a specific location.

Evidence such as hair ,Coat fibre, printed material found at the scene of crime which can help in determining the offender is called
trace evidence. Digital evidence such as IP address logs and search history also fall under this catogery.

Types of Evidence:
Biological Evidence: Includes blood and saliva
Drug Evidence: Can include marijuana,cocaine and other controlled substances.
Trace Evidence: Can include hair,synthetic fibre,electronic Printed data etc.
Print Evidence: It can include boot prints, car tyre impression etc
Digital Evidence: Trace logs,IP address logs, Search History etc.
Weapon Evidence: Can include types of ballistics, Weapons etc
Finger Print Evidence: can include fingerprint  of all 10 fingers.

=====================================================================================================
# Techniques of Investigation

- Two general methods of investigation:
- Accusatorial
- Information Gathering

Properties of Investigation Process:
# RelationShip with the Suspect

Information Gathering: Building a positive rapport with the suspect and obtain a confession through positive confrontation.
Accusatorial: Confronting the suspect and obtaining a confession through manipulation and coercion.

# Questioning Approach
 IG- Open Ended question to allow the suspect to clarify and provide his side of story

 A- Closed Ended and Accusatory Questions

# Primary Intended Outcome
IG- Allow the suspect to provide a defense for himself

A- Obtain a Confession from the suspect

# Model of the Outcome

# Interrogation Techniques:

Reid Method:

Reid Method follows 3 basic steps:

Factual Analysis: Factual analysis is related to analyzing crime related evidence as well as performing analysis about the suspects which includes age,height,race,marital status.Furthurmore, opportunity or motive to commit a crime.Physical capacity to commit the crime to determine possible guity suspects in the process.

(Interview)Behavioural Interview Analysis: BIA approach is used in interview.In it suspect is asked normal background questions along with behaviour provoking questions to guage the suspects response for truth or deception.
- With simple background questions that are asked to build rapport behaviour provoking questions are asked as well to observe the response of the suspect and in this way his personality profile can be built as well.Also his response for truthufulness or deception is noted as well for the interogations step.

Major Suspects make it to interrogation step

Interrogation:
Interrogation is broken down in several steps:

1. Positive Confrontation: Suspect is confronted non-aggressively about the crime and his response is guaged and how he responds to this confrontation.

2. Theme Development: Interrogator develops a moral justification where is deflects the responsibility of the crime on someone else or external factor.While maintaining an understanding demeanor to the suspect.

3. Handling Denial: if the suspects asks permission for denying the accusation.The interrogator doesn,t allow him to do so . In most cases it is rare that an innocent person will move beyond denial.

4. Overcoming objections: Usually guilty suspects will try to justify or present objections for the interrogation such as 'I wouldn't do it because i love my job so much'.In this case the interrogator should accept the justification and use it to extrapolate on the theme.

5. Acquisition and Retention of Suspects: Attention of the suspect is focused on the theme scenario developed by the interrogator instead of punishment of the crime.

6. Handling passive mood of the suspect: Mood of the interrogation is elevated by intensifying the presentation of the theme  and concentrate on the central reason or justification the suspect is providing.

7. Having the suspect orate the events after submission of Guilt: Once the suspect admits the theme and his role in it .It is an admission of guilt and the interrogator immediatly make a statement to reassert his admission of guilt.After that instead of moving on to the details.The suspect is asked to provide a basic order or events.

8. Gaining Written Confession: Once oral admission is acquired.Interrogator should immediatly have the guilty suspect put it into writing form so that it can be admissible in court.

# Public Private Partnership (PPP)

PPP: PPP is a co-funding partnership of private and public entities such the government, police departments for providing a service or a public project.

2 main drivers of PPPs:

1. SO that the public sector can harness the expertise of the private sector which it usually doesnt have access to because funding or other factors.
2. So that for public projects that public organizations do not have to acquire huge loans.


Benefits of PPP:

- Harnessing the expertise of Private entities
- Shared responsibility for the project
- Cost efficiencies and skill .
- shared Bussiness networking


Problems and Hardships in implementing PPPs:

1. Flexibility: Private and Public entities are structured different and work on entirely different principles and for partnerships to work successfuly.Both of them must have flexibility to understands each-others respective requirements.

2. TimeLine: Non profit organizations usually have long term goals and these goals require a long termn commitment for their successful completion.While profit focused organizations are oriented towards short term profits which can create difference of interest within the parties.

3. Funding Focus: Lack of agreement between the parties regarding where funding should be applied to.This

4. Communication: Communication is a major factor in partnerships failure usually in contract agreement phases. Regarding progress,goals and rules.

5. Trust: Lack of trust often develops during projects in case of poor communication channels which can quickly cause a partnership to breakdown

6. Conflicts: Conflict on level of decision making in projects and changes related to it can lead to dissolution between the working parties.

7. Autonomy within the Partnership: Who will take the leadership role in the partnership and how it will transition and change can be a huge factor effecting PPPs.

How these factors can be mitigated:

1. Have a continuous narrative regarding short term and long term goals.These goals must be properly communicated to the partners along with the progress on them as well. Because lack of communication can erode trust between parties resulting in dissolution.

2. Have formal mechanism for important functions of the partnership.

- Well defined stucture for termination,negotiation and re-negotiation.Other items such conflict resolution, organization outreach should have a well defined framework.
- Always be ready for negotiation at any level in the project depending on the changing needs of both parties.


# Public private partnership in Policing

Goverments and official organizations have relied on the private citizens for solving crimes even before the formation of formal policing institutions.Such as Bounty hunting system is an example.

- In the modern world the rise of private protection and military organizations are serving that purpose in which governments can delegate assignments to them for compensations.
