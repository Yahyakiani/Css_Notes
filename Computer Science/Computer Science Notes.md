A computer science degree emphasizes computation theory and a wider range of subjects, including coding, algorithms, machine learning, database management, and information security.
- **Software engineering** applies the standards and principles of engineering to design, develop, maintain, test and evaluate computer software. A software engineer may also be referred to as a computer programmer, software designer or software developer as the nature of software engineering can require knowledge of programming languages, principles of software design and building.
- **Information technology**, on the other hand, refers to maintaining and troubleshooting those computers and their networks, systems, and databases to ensure they run smoothly.So while working

### Object Oriented Paradigm  

#### Main Notes
- Object-oriented paradigm:
- **Data abstraction**: is a programming design technique that relies on the separation of interface
and implementation.

Abstraction separates code into interface and implementation. So while designing your
component, you must keep interface independent of the implementation so that if you change
underlying implementation then interface would remain intact.
Benefits: Class internals are protected from inadvertent user-level errors, which might corrupt the
state of the object.
The class implementation may evolve over time in response to changing requirements or
bug reports without requiring change in user-level code.

- Encapsulation:Data encapsulation, also known as data hiding, is the mechanism whereby the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user. The user can only perform a restricted set of operations on the hidden members of the class by executing special functions commonly called methods.
- Inheritance:
- Polymorphism:
- There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants:
  Using #define preprocessor.
  Using const keyword

- **Files**
  - seekg moves the file input pointer(position of reading frm file) while seekp moves file output pointer( position f writing to file). Another question from juice answerable simply by reading the documentation
  - tellp():It returns the position of the current character in the output stream.	
  - tellg():It returns the position of the current character in the input stream.

- A friend function is a friend of a class that is allowed to access to Public, private, or protected data in that same class. If the function is defined outside the class cannot access such information.

A friend can be declared anywhere in the class declaration, and it cannot be affected by access control keywords like private, public, or protected.

- Static linking is the process of copying all library modules used in the program into the final executable image. In contrast, dynamic linking is the process of loading the external shared libraries into the program and then binds those shared libraries dynamically to the program
- A random access file is a file where you can "jump" to anywhere within it without having to read sequentially until the position you are interested in.

For example, say you have a 1MB file, and you are interested in 5 bytes that start after 100k of data. A random access file will allow you to "jump" to the 100k-th position in one operation. A non-random access file will require you to read 100k bytes first, and only then read the data you're interested in.
Today almost all files are randomly accessed

Then, Effective memory access time = (p*s) + (1-p)*m


#### Links:
- **Kernel** is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources. It also acts as a bridge between the application and hardware of the computer. It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader). 
- A **microkernel** is one of the classifications of the kernel. Being a kernel it manages all system resources. But in a microkernel, the user services and kernel services are implemented in different address spaces. The user services are kept in user address space, and kernel services are kept under kernel address space, thus also reduces the size of kernel and size of an operating system as well. 
- **Booting Process With BIOS** : When BIOS begins it’s execution, it first goes for the Power-On Self Test (POST), which ensures that the hardware devices are functioning correctly. After that, it checks for the Master Boot Record in the first sector of the selected boot device. From the MBR, the location of the Boot-Loader is retrieved, which, after being loaded by BIOS into the computer’s RAM, loads the operating system into the main memory.
- **Booting Process With UEFI** : Unlike basic input/output system**BIOS**, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface**UEFI** doesn’t look for the MBR in the first sector of the Boot Device. It maintains a list of valid boot volumes called EFI Service Partitions. During the POST procedure the UEFI firmware scans all of the bootable storage devices that are connected to the system for a valid GUID Partition Table (GPT), which is an improvement over MBR. Unlike the MBR, GPT doesn’t contain a Boot-Loader. The firmware itself scans the GPT to find an EFI Service Partition to boot from, and directly loads the OS from the right partition. If it fails to find one, it goes back the BIOS-type Booting process called ‘Legacy Boot’.
-  GPT -> EFI Service partition -> load os directly from there -> process fail then fall back to BIOS

- **Interrupt Latency** : Interrupt latency, also called interrupt response time, is the length of time that it takes for a computer interrupt to be acted on after it has been generated. In most computers, a trade-off exists among interrupt latency, throughput, and processor utilization.

- A process in Unix or Unix-like operating systems becomes a **zombie process** when it has completed execution but one or some of its entries are still in the process table. If a process is ended by an "exit" call, all memory associated with it is reallocated to a new process; in this way, the system saves memory.To remove the zombie process execute the kill command.
- A **Zombie** is a process that has completed its task but still, it shows an entry in a process table. A child process that remains running even after its parent process is terminated or completed without waiting for the child process execution is called an **orphan**.Terminate the Orphan process using the SIGHUP signal.
- The basic difference between **Spooling and Buffering** is that Spooling overlaps the input/output of one job with the execution of another job while the buffering overlaps the input/output of one job with the execution of the same job.22-Nov-2019
- **Difference between Deadlock, Starvation, and Livelock:**
A **livelock** is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing. Livelock is a special case of resource starvation; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing.
- **Starvation** is a problem which is closely related to both, Livelock and Deadlock. In a dynamic system, requests for resources keep on happening. Thereby, some policy is needed to make a decision about who gets the resource when. This process, being reasonable, may lead to a some processes never getting serviced even though they are not deadlocked.

- Important : How address is converted and other stuff: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-allocation-techniques-mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/
- A **page fault** is an interruption that occurs when a software program attempts to access a memory block not currently stored in the system's RAM. This exception tells the operating system to find the block in virtual memory so it can be sent from a device's storage (SSD or HD) to RAM.
- Steps When page fault occurs and Virtual Memory: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/
- **Inverted Page Table** An alternate approach is to use the Inverted Page Table structure that consists of one-page table entry for every frame of the main memory. So the number of page table entries in the Inverted Page Table reduces to the number of frames in physical memory and a single page table is used to represent the paging information of all the processes
- **Segmentation vs Paging**: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-paging-and-segmentation
- **Memory Interleaving** is designed to compensate for the relatively slow speed of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or core memory by spreading memory addresses evenly across memory banks.
- **A translation lookaside buffer (TLB)** is a memory cache that stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory. It is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location. It can be called an address-translation cache. It is a part of the chip's memory-management unit (MMU).
- How to handle thrashing look last: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/
- Dynamic loading vs static loading and dynamic linking vs static linking: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.html
- SImple vs virtual paging: In simple paging, all the pages of a process must be in main memory for process to run, unless overlays are used.
- **Swap space** helps the computer's operating system in pretending that it has more RAM than it actually has. It is also called a swap file. This interchange of data between virtual memory and real memory is called swapping and space on disk as “swap space”.
But in virtual memory, not all pages of a process need be in main memory frames for the process to run. Pages may be read in as needed
- **Demand paging** is a process by which the operating system loads or copies a disk page into the physical memory, if an attempt to access the page is made and the page is not already present in the physical memory.

STEPS:

    Attempt to access the page 
    If the page is present in memory, process instructions 
    If the page is not, then a page-fault trap occurs
    Check if the memory reference is a valid reference to a location on secondary memory. If not, the process is terminated (illegal memory access). Otherwise, we have to page in the required page.
    Schedule disk operation to read the desired page into main memory.
    Restart the operation that was interrupted

- Page replacement algorithms: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/
  - **First In First Out (FIFO)**: This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
  - **Optimal Page replacement** : In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future. 
  -  **Least Recently Used** :In this algorithm, page will be replaced which is least recently used

#### Cohesion is an indication of the relative functional strength of a module. 
is a natural extension of the information-hiding concept described in Section 12.3.6. A cohesive module performs a single task, requiring little interaction with other components in other parts of a program. Stated simply, a cohesive module should (ideally) do just one thing. Although you should always strive for high cohesion (i.e., single-mindedness)

 https://www.globalguideline.com/interview_questions/Questions.php?sc=Image_Processing_Expert
#### Main Notes
- Linear filtering is the filtering method in which the value of output pixel is linear combinations of the neighbouring input pixels. it can be done with convolution.For examples, mean/average filters or Gaussian filtering.
- A non-linear filtering is one that cannot be done with convolution or Fourier multiplication. A sliding median filter is a simple example of a non-linear filter.

## Web Engineering & Technologies 
 
#### Main Notes
-  **Properties For Website Modeling**
  -  web applications from three orthogonal perspectives (levels of modeling): web navigation,
web content and web behavior
   - **Web Navigation**
     - **Static navigation properties**:It addresses the checking of properties such as broken links, reachability
(e.g., return to the home page), consistency of frame structure, and other features related
to estimating the cost of navigation, such as longest path analysis.
     - **Dynamic navigation properties**: This analysis focuses on aspects that make the navigation
dynamic. That is, the same link may lead to different pages depending on given inputs.

     - **Interaction navigation properties**: This analysis focuses on properties that are related to
user navigation that happens outside the control of the web application, such as user
interaction with the browser. This includes features such as use of the back or forward
buttons.
   - **Web Content**
     - **Static content properties**: Consistency of the original web page content with respect to
syntax and semantics. Two properties are explored in this category, completeness/
     - **Dynamic content properties**: Consistency of the syntax and semantics of dynamic content.
This analysis requires the ability to check the dynamically generated content that results
from the execution of script code 
   - **Web Behavior**
     - **Security properties**: This issue is related to access control mechanisms that are employed
on the web content or web links. This issue could also be employed on the back-end, as
the database may contain data reserved to specific users. Non-authorized users must not
be able to access such data. These properties are also tied to session control mechanisms.
     - **Instruction processing properties**: These issues include both server and client side
execution. We define client-side execution as any process changing the state of the
application without communication with the web server. 


- Major Modeling Techniques:
- **Presentation Modeling**
  - **Objectives**:
    - Designing the structure and behavior of the user interface to ensure that interaction
    with the Web application is simple and self-explanatory
    - Communication and representation task of the Web application are taken into account
    - Results: a uniform presentation concept by modeling recurring elements on the pages, e.g.,
    headers and footers. It should ideally show the composition of each page and the
    design of the fields, texts, images, forms, etc., included in these pages.
    - describtiion of the behavior-oriented aspects of the user interface, e.g., which
    button to click to activate a function of the application logic.
    - Give users appropriate orientation help on the presentation level
     due to the wide variety of navigation options and the inherent risk of getting lost
    - Can be achieved, e.g., by displaying the current navigation path, or pages visited
    during the active session
    - Model elements are described on three hierarchical levels:
      - **Presentation page**: a page presented to the user as a
  visualization unit. It can be composed of different presentation
  units.
      - **Presentation unit**: serves to group related user interface
  elements, representing a logical fragment of the page. It
  presents a node stemming from the hypertext model.
      - **Presentation element**: basic building block of the presentation
  model. Presentation elements represent a node’s set of
infor-mation and can include text, images, audio, etc.

- **Affiliate Marketing** Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person's or company's products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make.
- **Search Engine Marketing** Google Ads  
- **Content-related Marketing** Content marketing is a marketing strategy used to attract, engage, and retain an audience by creating and sharing relevant articles, videos, podcasts, and other media
- **Search Engine Optimization**
- Social Media Marketing Campaigns : Youtube and Facebook
- **Leverage Mobile Visits**: One of the objectives of developing web applications or web apps is to make it accessible from a mobile device.
15. Web Testing:
- **Link Testing**
- **Browser Testing** 
- **Usability Testing** : Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.
  - For example, if you are designing a website for a supermarket, and that website allows users to do their groceries online, the best way of testing your design is by having a user proceed through your product as you watch them trying to buy their groceries
- **Load, Stress** (Performance Testing):https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/performance-testing-vs-load-testing-vs-stress-testing
- **Testing Security** 
- **Test-driven Development** 
- **Continuous testing** (CT) is a software development process in which applications are tested continuously throughout the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). The goal of CT is to evaluate software quality across the SDLC, providing critical feedback earlier and enabling higher-quality and faster deliveries
  - The code is continuously developed, delivered, tested and deployed. For Example, whenever a developer checks the code in the Source Code Server like Jenkins automated set of unit tests are executed in the continuous process. If the tests fail, the build is rejected, and the developer is notified.
