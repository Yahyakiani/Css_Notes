##  Sensation and Perception 

- **Types of Perception**
    Vision.
    Touch.
    Sound.
    Taste.
    Smell

- **Weber’s law** A basic law of psychophysics stating that a just noticeable 
difference is a constant proportion to 
the intensity of an initial stimulus 
(rather than a constant amount)
  - **Example:** For example, Weber found that the just noticeable difference for weight is 1:50. 
Consequently, it takes a 1-ounce increase in a 50-ounce weight to produce a noticeable difference, and it would take a 10-ounce increase to produce a noticeable difference if the initial weight were 500 ounces.
  - **Explains** Weber’s law helps explain why a person in a quiet room is more startled by the 
ringing of a telephone than is a person in an already noisy room. To produce the 
same amount of reaction in a noisy room, a telephone ring might have to approximate the loudness of cathedral bells.

- **Theories of Vision**
  -  **Trichromatic theory of color vision**  This theory suggests that there 
are three kinds of cones in the retina, each of which responds primarily to a specifi c 
range of wavelengths. One is most responsive to blue-violet colors, one to green, and 
the third to yellow-red (Brown & Wald, 1964). According to trichromatic theory, perception of color is infl uenced by the relative strength with which each of the three 
kinds of cones is activated. If we see a blue sky, the blue-violet cones are primarily 
triggered, and the others show less activity
      - **Criticism** trichromatic theory does not 
explain color vision completely. Why should the colors in the afterimage be different 
from those in the original?
     - **Given By** Thomas Young
  
  -  **Opponent-process theory of color vision**  there are a blue-yellow pairing, a red-green pairing, and a black-white pairing. If an object refl ects light that contains more blue than yellow, it will stimulate 
the fi ring of the cells sensitive to blue, simultaneously discouraging or inhibiting the 
fi ring of receptor cells sensitive to yellow—and the object will appear blue. If, in 
contrast, a light contains more yellow than blue, the cells that respond to yellow will 
be stimulated to fi re while the blue ones are inhibited, and the object will appear 
yellow
      - **Explains Afterimage** When 
we stare at the yellow in the fi gure, for instance, our receptor cells for the yellow 
component of the yellow-blue pairing become fatigued and are less able to respond 
to yellow stimuli. In contrast, the receptor cells for the blue part of the pair are not 
tired, because they are not being stimulated. When we look at a white surface, the 
light refl ected off it would normally stimulate both the yellow and the blue receptors 
equally. But the fatigue of the yellow receptors prevents this from happening. They 
temporarily do not respond to the yellow, which makes the white light appear to be 
blue

- **Theories of Hearing**
  - **Place Theory of Hearing**  Basilar membrane 
nearest to the oval window is most sensitive to high-frequency sounds, and the part 
nearest to the cochlea’s inner end is most sensitive to low-frequency sounds. This 
fi nding has led to the place theory of hearing , which states that different areas of 
the basilar membrane respond to different frequencies 
    - **Criticism**  place theory does not tell the full story of hearing, because very low 
frequency sounds trigger neurons across such a wide area of the basilar membrane 
that no single site is involved. Consequently, an additional explanation for hearing 
has been proposed: frequency theory
  - **frequency theory of hearing** suggests that 
the entire basilar membrane acts as a microphone, vibrating as a whole in response 
to a sound. According to this explanation, the nerve receptors send out signals that 
are tied directly to the frequency (the number of wave crests per second) of the 
sounds to which we are exposed, with the number of nerve impulses being a direct 
function of a sound’s frequency. Thus, the higher the pitch of a sound (and therefore 
the greater the frequency of its wave crests), the greater the number of nerve impulses 
that are transmitted up the auditory nerve to the brain
  - **Both Issue**  Neither place theory nor frequency theory provides the full explanation for hearing. Place theory provides a better explanation for the sensing of high-frequency.sounds, whereas frequency theory explains what happens when low-frequency 
sounds are encountered. Medium-frequency sounds incorporate both processes 

- **Gate-control theory of pain** , particular 
nerve receptors in the spinal cord lead to specifi c areas of the 
brain related to pain. When these receptors are activated 
because of an injury or problem with a part of the body, a 
“gate” to the brain is opened, allowing us to experience the 
sensation of pain (Melzack & Katz, 2004). 
However, another set of neural receptors can, when stimulated, close the “gate” to the brain, thereby reducing the experience of pain. The gate can be shut in two different ways.
  -  nonpainful stimuli compete with 
and sometimes displace the neural message of pain, thereby shutting off the painful 
stimulus. This explains why rubbing the skin around an injury  
  - Gate-control theory also may explain cultural differences in the experience of 
pain. Some of these variations are astounding. For example, in India people who 
participate in the “hook-swinging” ritual to celebrate the power of the gods have 
steel hooks embedded under the skin and muscles of their backs .Also explains Acupuncture chinese

- **Gestalt Laws of Organization**
  - **closure** : We usually group elements to form enclosed or complete figures rather than open on 
  - **proximity** : We perceive elements that are closer 
together as grouped together. As a result, we tend to see pairs 
of dots rather than a row of single dots
  - **similarity** in appearance we perceive as 
grouped together. We see, then, horizontal rows of circles and 
squares 
  - **simplicity** : When we observe a pattern, we perceive it in the 
most basic, straightforward manner that we can
  - Example: Images on `Page 181`
  - One fundamental gestalt principle that remains infl uential is that two 
objects considered together form a whole that is different 
from the simple combination of the objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that the perception of stimuli in our environment 
goes well beyond the individual elements that we sense. 
Instead, it represents an active, constructive process carried 
out within the brain

## Learning

-  **classical conditioning** A type of 
learning in which a neutral stimulus 
comes to bring about a response after 
it is paired with a stimulus that 
naturally brings about that response.
   - **Given By** Ivan Pavlov
   - **Example** Learning by means of classical conditioning also occurs during adulthood. For 
example, you may not go to a dentist as often as you should because of previous 
associations of dentists with pain. In more extreme cases, classical conditioning can 
lead to the development of phobias.
   - PTSD in war veterans who have had traumatic experiences, can also be produced by classical 
conditioning

- **Thorndike’s Law of Effect** 
  - Responses that lead to satisfying consequences are more likely to be repeated. 
- **OPERANT CONDITIONING**  page 238
  - **Given by** B. F. Skinner
-  **COMPARING CLASSICAL AND OPERANT CONDITIONING** Page 247
- **behavior modification Strategies**  The techniques used by behavior analysts are as varied as the list of processes 
that modify behavior. They include reinforcement scheduling, shaping, generalization training, discrimination training, and extinction. Participants in a behaviorchange program do, however, typically follow a series of similar basic steps that   

-  **Cognitive Approaches to Learning**
   -  **cognitive learning theory** An 
approach to the study of learning that 
focuses on the thought processes that 
underlie learning 
   - **latent learning** Behaviour is acquired but not shown unless a motivation is present.
     - Latent learning puts question on Operant Conditioning `pg 254` 

   - **observational learning or Social learning theory** Learning by 
observing the behavior of another 
person, or model.
     - **Given by** Albert Bandura
     - Observational learning is particularly important in acquiring skills in which the 
operant conditioning technique of shaping is inappropriate. Piloting an airplane and 
performing brain surgery, for example, are behaviors that could hardly be learned 
by using trial-and-error methods without grave cost—literally—to 
   - **Insight learning theory** is proposed by Wolfgang Kohler. Insight learning is the sudden understanding of the relation between a problem and a solution. By learning through insight, the correct solution not only appears seemingly out of nowhere but also repeated readily of subsequent presentations of that problem

- **levels-of-processing theory** The 
theory of memory that emphasizes the 
degree to which new material is 
mentally analyzed.

  - At **shallow levels**, 
information is processed merely in terms of its physical and sensory aspects. For 
example, we may pay attention only to the shapes that make up the letters in the 
word dog . 
  - At an **intermediate level of processing**, the shapes are translated into meaningful units—in this case, letters of the alphabet. Those letters are considered in the 
context of words, and specific phonetic sounds may be attached to the letters. 
  - **deepest level of processing**, information is analyzed in terms of its meaning. We may see it in a wider context and draw associations between the meaning 
of the information and broader networks of knowledge

- **Forgetting and reasons for forgetting**
  - **Decay** is the loss of information through nonuse. 
    - **Physical Explaination** This explanation for forgetting 
assumes that memory traces, the physical changes that take place in the brain when 
new material is learned, simply fade away over time
  -  **interference** The phenomenon by 
which information in memory disrupts 
the recall of other information
     - **proactive interference** Interference in 
which information learned earlier 
disrupts the recall of newer material. 
     - **retroactive interference** Interference 
in which there is diffi culty in the recall 
of information learned earlier because 
of later exposure to different materia
  - **cue-dependent forgetting** Forgetting 
that occurs when there are insuffi cient 
retrieval cues to rekindle information 
that is in memory
  - **Medical Problems** Alzheimer’s disease An illness 
characterized in part by severe 
memory problems. 

##  Motivation and Emotion 

#### Theories of Motivation or Approaches

-  **Instinct Approaches**: According 
to instinct approaches to motivation, people and animals are born preprogrammed 
with sets of behaviors essential to their survival. Those instincts provide the energy 
that channels behavior in appropriate directions. Hence, sexual behavior may be a 
response to an instinct to reproduce, and exploratory behavior may be motivated by 
an instinct to examine one’s territory. 
   - **motivation** The factors that direct and 
energize the behavior of humans and 
other organisms. 
   - **instincts** Inborn patterns of behavior 
that are biologically determined rather 
than learned
   - **Problem**: This conception presents several diffi culties, however. For one thing, psychologists do not agree on what, or even how many, primary instincts exist. One early 
psychologist, William McDougall (1908), suggested that there are 18 instincts


- **Drive-reduction** approaches to 
motivation suggest that a lack of some basic biological requirement such as water 
produces a drive to obtain that requirement (in this case, the thirst drive). 
  - **Example**:  A drive is 
motivational tension, or arousal, that energizes behavior to fulfi ll a need. Many basic 
drives, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex, are related to biological needs of the 
body or of the species as a whole. These are called primary drives . Primary drives 
contrast with secondary drives in which behavior fulfi lls no obvious biological need. 
In secondary drives , prior experience and learning bring about needs. For instance, 
some people have strong needs to achieve academically and professionally
  - We usually try to satisfy a primary drive by reducing the need underlying it. For 
example, we become hungry after not eating for a few hours
  - **Problem** drive-reduction theories provide a good explanation of how primary 
drives motivate behavior, they cannot fully explain a behavior in which the goal is 
not to reduce a drive but rather to maintain or even increase the level of excitement 
or arousal.  Similarly, many people pursue thrilling activities such as riding a roller coaster or steering a raft down the rapids of a river

- **Homeostasis**, the body’s tendency to maintain a steady internal state, underlies primary drives. Using feedback loops, homeostasis brings deviations in body functioning back to an optimal state, similar to the way a thermostat does.

- **Arousal approaches to motivation**  According to arousal approaches to motivation, each person 
tries to maintain a certain level of stimulation and activity. As with the drivereduction model, this model suggests that if our stimulation and activity levels 
become too high, we try to reduce them. But, in contrast to the drive-reduction 
model, the arousal model also suggests that if levels of stimulation and activity are 
too low, we will try to increase them by seeking stimulation. 
 
  - **Example :** People vary widely in the optimal level of arousal they seek out, with some people 
looking for especially high levels of arousal. For example, people who participate in 
daredevil sports, high-stakes gamblers, and criminals who pull off high-risk robberies 
may be exhibiting a particularly high need for arousal 

- **Incentive approaches** to motivation suggest that motivation stems from the 
desire to obtain valued external goals, or incentives. In this view, the desirable properties of external stimuli—whether grades, money, affection, food, or sex—account 
for a person’s motivation 

  -  **Problem** it does 
not provide a complete explanation of motivation because organisms sometimes seek 
to fulfi ll needs even when incentives are not apparent.

- **Cognitive approaches to motivation** suggest that motivation is a product of people’s 
thoughts, expectations, and goals—their cognitions. 
  - **Example** :For instance, the degree to which 
people are motivated to study for a test is based on their expectation of how well 
studying will pay off in terms of a good grade
  - Explain: Cognitive theories of motivation draw a key distinction between intrinsic and 
extrinsic motivation. 

  - **Intrinsic motivation** causes us to participate in an activity for our 
own enjoyment rather than for any concrete, tangible reward that it will bring us. In 
contrast, 
  - **extrinsic motivation** causes us to do something for money, a grade, or some 
other concrete, tangible reward. For example, when a physician works long hours 
because she loves medicine

- **Maslow’s model** places motivational needs in a hierarchy and suggests that 
before more sophisticated, higher-order needs can be met, certain primary needs 
must be satisfied
  - **Problem** Although research has been unable to validate the specific ordering of Maslow’s 
stages, and it is difficult to measure self-actualization objectively, Maslow’s hierarchy 
of needs is important for two reasons: It highlights the complexity of human needs, 
and it emphasizes the idea that until more basic biological needs are met, people will 
be relatively unconcerned with higher-order needs 
  - **Abraham Maslow**


- **self-determination theory** that people have the three basic needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. 
Competence is the need to produce desired outcomes, while autonomy is the perception that we have control over our own lives.Finally, relatedness is the need to be 
involved in close, warm relationships with others. In the view of self-determination 
theory, these three psychological needs are innate and universal across cultures, and 
they are essential as basic biological needs

- **Functions of Emotions**
  1. **Preparing us for action** . Emotions act as a link between events in our environment and our responses. For example, if you saw an angry dog charging 
toward you, your emotional reaction would be fear.
  2. **Shaping our future behavior** . Emotions promote learning that will help us make 
appropriate responses in the future. For instance, your emotional response to 
unpleasant events teaches you to avoid similar circumstances in the future. 
  3. **Helping us interact** more effectively with others . We often communicate the 
emotions we experience through our verbal and nonverbal behaviors, making 
our emotions obvious to observers. T 

#### Theories of Emotion

-  **James-Lange theory of emotion**  James and Lange proposed that we experience emotions as a result of 
physiological changes that produce specifi c sensations. The brain interprets these 
sensations as specifi c kinds of emotional experiences (see the fi rst part of Figure 2). 
This view has come to be called the James-Lange theory of emotion
   - They suggested that for every major emotion there is an accompanying physiological or “gut” 
reaction of internal organs—called a **visceral experience**
   - **Drawback** James-Lange theory has some serious drawbacks, however. For the theory 
to be valid, visceral changes would have to occur relatively quickly because we 
experience some emotions—such as fear upon hearing a stranger rapidly approaching 
on a dark night—almost instantaneously. Yet emotional experiences frequently occur 
even before there is time for certain physiological changes to be set into motion. 
Because of the slowness with which some visceral changes take place, it is hard to 
see how they could be the source of immediate emotional experience
     - **Another issue**:  Physiological arousal does not 
invariably produce emotional experience. For example, a person who is jogging has 
an increased heartbeat and respiration rate as well as many of the other physiological 
changes associated with certain emotions. Yet joggers typically do not think of such 
changes in terms of emotion
   - **William James and Carl Lange**

- **CANNON-BARD THEORY** This theory rejects the view that physiological arousal alone 
leads to the perception of emotion. Instead, the theory assumes that both physiological 
arousal and the emotional experience are produced simultaneously by the same nerve 
stimulus, which Cannon and Bard suggested emanates from the thalamus in the brain.
  - **Explain**  thalamus is the initial site of the emotional response. Next, the thalamus sends a signal 
to the autonomic nervous system,
  - **Criticism** Recent research 
has led to some important modifications of the theory. For one thing, we now understand that the hypothalamus and the limbic system, not the thalamus, play a major 
role in emotional experience. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of the physiological and emotional responses, which is a fundamental assumption of the Cannon.Bard theory, has yet to be demonstrated conclusively.
  - **Walter Cannon and Philip Bard**
   
- **SCHACHTER-SINGER THEORY(Cognitive Perspective)** According to an explanation that focuses on the role of cognition, the SchachterSinger theory of emotion, this might very well happen. This approach to explaining emotions emphasizes that we identify the emotion we are experiencing by 
observing our environment and comparing ourselves with others
