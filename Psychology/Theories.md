##  Sensation and Perception 

- **Weber’s law** A basic law of psychophysics stating that a just noticeable 
difference is a constant proportion to 
the intensity of an initial stimulus 
(rather than a constant amount)
  - **Example:** For example, Weber found that the just noticeable difference for weight is 1:50. 
Consequently, it takes a 1-ounce increase in a 50-ounce weight to produce a noticeable difference, and it would take a 10-ounce increase to produce a noticeable difference if the initial weight were 500 ounces.
  - **Explains** Weber’s law helps explain why a person in a quiet room is more startled by the 
ringing of a telephone than is a person in an already noisy room. To produce the 
same amount of reaction in a noisy room, a telephone ring might have to approximate the loudness of cathedral bells.

- **Theories of Vision**
  -  **Trichromatic theory of color vision**  This theory suggests that there 
are three kinds of cones in the retina, each of which responds primarily to a specifi c 
range of wavelengths. One is most responsive to blue-violet colors, one to green, and 
the third to yellow-red (Brown & Wald, 1964). According to trichromatic theory, perception of color is infl uenced by the relative strength with which each of the three 
kinds of cones is activated. If we see a blue sky, the blue-violet cones are primarily 
triggered, and the others show less activity
      - **Criticism** trichromatic theory does not 
explain color vision completely. Why should the colors in the afterimage be different 
from those in the original?

  -  **Opponent-process theory of color vision**  there are a blue-yellow pairing, a red-green pairing, and a black-white pairing. If an object refl ects light that contains more blue than yellow, it will stimulate 
the fi ring of the cells sensitive to blue, simultaneously discouraging or inhibiting the 
fi ring of receptor cells sensitive to yellow—and the object will appear blue. If, in 
contrast, a light contains more yellow than blue, the cells that respond to yellow will 
be stimulated to fi re while the blue ones are inhibited, and the object will appear 
yellow
      - **Explains Afterimage** When 
we stare at the yellow in the fi gure, for instance, our receptor cells for the yellow 
component of the yellow-blue pairing become fatigued and are less able to respond 
to yellow stimuli. In contrast, the receptor cells for the blue part of the pair are not 
tired, because they are not being stimulated. When we look at a white surface, the 
light refl ected off it would normally stimulate both the yellow and the blue receptors 
equally. But the fatigue of the yellow receptors prevents this from happening. They 
temporarily do not respond to the yellow, which makes the white light appear to be 
blue

- **Theories of Hearing**
  - **Place Theory of Hearing**  Basilar membrane 
nearest to the oval window is most sensitive to high-frequency sounds, and the part 
nearest to the cochlea’s inner end is most sensitive to low-frequency sounds. This 
fi nding has led to the place theory of hearing , which states that different areas of 
the basilar membrane respond to different frequencies 
    - **Criticism**  place theory does not tell the full story of hearing, because very low 
frequency sounds trigger neurons across such a wide area of the basilar membrane 
that no single site is involved. Consequently, an additional explanation for hearing 
has been proposed: frequency theory
  - **frequency theory of hearing** suggests that 
the entire basilar membrane acts as a microphone, vibrating as a whole in response 
to a sound. According to this explanation, the nerve receptors send out signals that 
are tied directly to the frequency (the number of wave crests per second) of the 
sounds to which we are exposed, with the number of nerve impulses being a direct 
function of a sound’s frequency. Thus, the higher the pitch of a sound (and therefore 
the greater the frequency of its wave crests), the greater the number of nerve impulses 
that are transmitted up the auditory nerve to the brain
  - **Both Issue**  Neither place theory nor frequency theory provides the full explanation for hearing. Place theory provides a better explanation for the sensing of high-frequency.sounds, whereas frequency theory explains what happens when low-frequency 
sounds are encountered. Medium-frequency sounds incorporate both processes 

- **Gate-control theory of pain** , particular 
nerve receptors in the spinal cord lead to specifi c areas of the 
brain related to pain. When these receptors are activated 
because of an injury or problem with a part of the body, a 
“gate” to the brain is opened, allowing us to experience the 
sensation of pain (Melzack & Katz, 2004). 
However, another set of neural receptors can, when stimulated, close the “gate” to the brain, thereby reducing the experience of pain. The gate can be shut in two different ways.
  -  nonpainful stimuli compete with 
and sometimes displace the neural message of pain, thereby shutting off the painful 
stimulus. This explains why rubbing the skin around an injury  
  - Gate-control theory also may explain cultural differences in the experience of 
pain. Some of these variations are astounding. For example, in India people who 
participate in the “hook-swinging” ritual to celebrate the power of the gods have 
steel hooks embedded under the skin and muscles of their backs .Also explains Acupuncture chinese

- **Gestalt Laws of Organization**
  - **closure** : We usually group elements to form enclosed or complete figures rather than open on 
  - **proximity** : We perceive elements that are closer 
together as grouped together. As a result, we tend to see pairs 
of dots rather than a row of single dots
  - **similarity** in appearance we perceive as 
grouped together. We see, then, horizontal rows of circles and 
squares 
  - **simplicity** : When we observe a pattern, we perceive it in the 
most basic, straightforward manner that we can
  - Example: Images on `Page 181`
  - One fundamental gestalt principle that remains infl uential is that two 
objects considered together form a whole that is different 
from the simple combination of the objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that the perception of stimuli in our environment 
goes well beyond the individual elements that we sense. 
Instead, it represents an active, constructive process carried 
out within the brain

## Learning

-  **classical conditioning** A type of 
learning in which a neutral stimulus 
comes to bring about a response after 
it is paired with a stimulus that 
naturally brings about that response.
   - **Given By** Ivan Pavlov
   - **Example** Learning by means of classical conditioning also occurs during adulthood. For 
example, you may not go to a dentist as often as you should because of previous 
associations of dentists with pain. In more extreme cases, classical conditioning can 
lead to the development of phobias.
   - PTSD in war veterans who have had traumatic experiences, can also be produced by classical 
conditioning

- **Thorndike’s Law of Effect** 
  - Responses that lead to satisfying consequences are more likely to be repeated.

that modify behavior. They include reinforcement scheduling, shaping, generalization training, discrimination training, and extinction. Participants in a behaviorchange program do, however, typically follow a series of similar basic steps that
