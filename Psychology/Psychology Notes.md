### Definition and scope

- Psychology is the scientific study of Behaviour and Mental Processes. Behaviour and Mental Processes doesnt only involve what humans do and think but rather perception,emotions,reasonining processes and even biological processes that maintain the body.

- Behaviour Neuroscience is a subfield of psychology that deals with how brain, the nervous system and other biological processes determine behaviour.Like certain areas of brain causing tremors in muscles of those suffereing from parkinson,s disease.

- Experimental Psychology deals with sensing,percieving, learning and thinking about the world.
    - Sub Specialy of Experimental Psychology:
    1. Cognitive Psychology : It involves higher mental processes like thinking,Memory, Decision making, judging, Problem solving and language .Like a cognitive pstchology might be interested in what a victim of a plane crash might remember about their experience.

- Developmental Psychology studies how a person grows from the point of conception to death.
- Personality Psychology studies how a person changes over a course of time and what traits are consist in his personality.Moreover,it also deals with the traits that differentiate one person from another.

### Psychology as a Science

### Schools of thought and Perspective
- Seven thousand years ago, people assumed that psychological problems were caused by 
evil spirits. To allow those spirits to escape from a person’s body, ancient healers chipped 
a hole in a patient’s skull with crude instruments—a procedure called **trephining** . 
- **Tabula Rasa** John locke a british philosopher of 17 century believed that children were born into this world with blank slates `(Tabula Rasa)`.
- **Structuralism** Wilhem wundt,s approach which deals with uncovering fundamental mental components of consciousness ,thinking,perception and emotions along with other mental tasks.
- 
- **Introspection** A procedure used by Wilhem wundt to understand how basic sensory processes build our understanding of the world.They presented people with a stimulus—such as a bright green object or a sentence printed on a card—and asked them to describe, in their own words and in as much detail as they could, what they were experiencing. Wundt argued that by analyzing people’s 
reports, psychologists could come to a better understanding of the structure of the mind.


- **Functionalism** The perspective that replaced structuralism is known as functionalism. Rather 
than focusing on the mind’s structure, functionalism concentrated on what the mind 
does and how behavior functions.Functionalists, whose perspective became prominent in the early 1900s, asked what role behavior plays in allowing people to adapt 
to their environments. For example, a functionalist might examine the function of 
the emotion of fear in preparing us to deal with emergency situations. 

- The American educator John Dewey drew  on functionalism to develop the fi eld of school psychology, proposing ways to best meet students’ educational needs. 

- **Gestalt Psychology** Another important reaction to structuralism was the development of gestalt 
psychology in the early 1900s. Gestalt psychology emphasizes how perception is 
organized. Instead of considering the individual parts that make up thinking, gestalt 
psychologists took the opposite tack, studying how people consider individual 
elements together as units or wholes. Led by German scientists such as Hermann 
Ebbinghaus and Max Wertheimer, gestalt psychologists proposed that “The whole is 
different from the sum of its parts,” meaning that our perception, or understanding, 
of objects is greater and more meaningful than the individual elements that make up 
our perceptions.

- **Womens contribution to Psychology** Despite the hurdles they faced, women made notable contributions to psychology,  although their impact on the field was largely overlooked until recently. 
For example, 
Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to receive a doctorate in 
psychology, and she did important work on animal behavior. Leta Stetter Hollingworth 
(1886–1939) was one of the fi rst psychologists to focus on child development and on 
women’s issues. She collected data to refute the view, popular in the early 1900s, that 
women’s abilities periodically declined during parts of the menstrual cycle.y. Anna Freud (1895–1982), the daughter of Sigmund Freud, 
also made notable contributions to the treatment of abnormal behavior,


### Recent Trends and Models of Psychology

- For Recent trends must go thorough page 73 and 74 of Understanding Psychology by Feldman
  Total 5 modern perspectives:

  1.  **Neuroscience perspective** The approach  that views behavior from the perspective of the brain, the nervous system, and other biological functions. 
  2.  **Psychodynamic perspective** The approach based on the view that behavior is motivated by unconscious inner forces over which the individual has little control.
  3.  **Behavioral perspective** The approach that suggests that observable, measurable behavior should be the focus of study.
  4.  **cognitive perspective** The approach that focuses on how people think, understand, and know about the world.
  5.   **Humanistic perspective** The approach that suggests that all individuals naturally strive to grow, develop, and be in control of their lives and behavior. 

- Point of Contention and Debate in the Psychology
-  Nature(Hereditary) vs Nurture( Enviromental Influences)
-  Concious vs unconcious behaviour
-  Free will vs determinism
-  Observable vs Internal processes and behaviours
-  Individual DIfferences(Unique personality) vs universal Principles(Product of culture and society)
