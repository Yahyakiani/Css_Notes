### Definition and scope

- Psychology is the scientific study of Behaviour and Mental Processes. Behaviour and Mental Processes doesnt only involve what humans do and think but rather perception,emotions,reasonining processes and even biological processes that maintain the body.

- Behaviour Neuroscience is a subfield of psychology that deals with how brain, the nervous system and other biological processes determine behaviour.Like certain areas of brain causing tremors in muscles of those suffereing from parkinson,s disease.

- Experimental Psychology deals with sensing,percieving, learning and thinking about the world.
    - Sub Specialy of Experimental Psychology:
    1. Cognitive Psychology : It involves higher mental processes like thinking,Memory, Decision making, judging, Problem solving and language .Like a cognitive pstchology might be interested in what a victim of a plane crash might remember about their experience.

- Developmental Psychology studies how a person grows from the point of conception to death.
- Personality Psychology studies how a person changes over a course of time and what traits are consist in his personality.Moreover,it also deals with the traits that differentiate one person from another.

### Psychology as a Science

### Schools of thought and Perspective
- Seven thousand years ago, people assumed that psychological problems were caused by 
evil spirits. To allow those spirits to escape from a person’s body, ancient healers chipped 
a hole in a patient’s skull with crude instruments—a procedure called **trephining** . 
- **Tabula Rasa** John locke a british philosopher of 17 century believed that children were born into this world with blank slates `(Tabula Rasa)`.
- **Structuralism** Wilhem wundt,s approach which deals with uncovering fundamental mental components of consciousness ,thinking,perception and emotions along with other mental tasks.
- 
- **Introspection** A procedure used by Wilhem wundt to understand how basic sensory processes build our understanding of the world.They presented people with a stimulus—such as a bright green object or a sentence printed on a card—and asked them to describe, in their own words and in as much detail as they could, what they were experiencing. Wundt argued that by analyzing people’s 
reports, psychologists could come to a better understanding of the structure of the mind.


- **Functionalism** The perspective that replaced structuralism is known as functionalism. Rather 
than focusing on the mind’s structure, functionalism concentrated on what the mind 
does and how behavior functions.Functionalists, whose perspective became prominent in the early 1900s, asked what role behavior plays in allowing people to adapt 
to their environments. For example, a functionalist might examine the function of 
the emotion of fear in preparing us to deal with emergency situations. 

- The American educator John Dewey drew  on functionalism to develop the fi eld of school psychology, proposing ways to best meet students’ educational needs. 

- **Gestalt Psychology** Another important reaction to structuralism was the development of gestalt 
psychology in the early 1900s. Gestalt psychology emphasizes how perception is 
organized. Instead of considering the individual parts that make up thinking, gestalt 
psychologists took the opposite tack, studying how people consider individual 
elements together as units or wholes. Led by German scientists such as Hermann 
Ebbinghaus and Max Wertheimer, gestalt psychologists proposed that “The whole is 
different from the sum of its parts,” meaning that our perception, or understanding, 
of objects is greater and more meaningful than the individual elements that make up 
our perceptions.

- **Womens contribution to Psychology** Despite the hurdles they faced, women made notable contributions to psychology,  although their impact on the field was largely overlooked until recently. 
For example, 
Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to receive a doctorate in 
psychology, and she did important work on animal behavior. Leta Stetter Hollingworth 
(1886–1939) was one of the fi rst psychologists to focus on child development and on 
women’s issues. She collected data to refute the view, popular in the early 1900s, that 
women’s abilities periodically declined during parts of the menstrual cycle.y. Anna Freud (1895–1982), the daughter of Sigmund Freud, 
also made notable contributions to the treatment of abnormal behavior,


### Recent Trends and Models of Psychology

- For Recent trends must go thorough page 73 and 74 of Understanding Psychology by Feldman
  Total 5 modern perspectives:

  1.  **Neuroscience perspective** The approach  that views behavior from the perspective of the brain, the nervous system, and other biological functions. 
  2.  **Psychodynamic perspective** The approach based on the view that behavior is motivated by unconscious inner forces over which the individual has little control.
  3.  **Behavioral perspective** The approach that suggests that observable, measurable behavior should be the focus of study.
  4.  **cognitive perspective** The approach that focuses on how people think, understand, and know about the world.
  5.   **Humanistic perspective** The approach that suggests that all individuals naturally strive to grow, develop, and be in control of their lives and behavior. 

- Point of Contention and Debate in the Psychology
-  Nature(Hereditary) vs Nurture( Enviromental Influences)
-  Concious vs unconcious behaviour
-  Free will vs determinism
-  Observable vs Internal processes and behaviours
-  Individual DIfferences(Unique personality) vs universal Principles(Product of culture and society)

## Part 2

### Nervous System , Neuron and its function

- **BioPsychologists or Behavioural Neuroscientists** Psychologists who specialize in how biology and body functions determine or effect behaviour.
- Around 1 trillion neurons in a human brain
- **Dendrite** A cluster of fi bers at one end  of a neuron that receives messages from other neurons.
- **Axon** The part of the neuron that carries messages destined for other neurons. 
-  **Terminal buttons** Small bulges at the end of axons that send messages to other neurons. 
-   **Myelin sheath** A protective coat of fat and protein that wraps around the axon.myelin sheath also serves to increase the velocity with which electrical impulses travel through axons. Those axons that carry the most important and most urgently required information have the greatest concentrations of myelin. If your hand touches a painfully hot stove, for example, the information regarding the pain is passed through axons in the hand and arm that have a relatively thick 
coating of myelin, speeding the message of pain to the brain so that you can react 
instantly.  

 **all-or-none law** The rule that neurons are either on or off.
  
  ![alt text](neurons.PNG)

**resting state** The state in which there is a negative electrical charge of about –70 millivolts within a neuron.Also  Like a gun, neurons either fire—that is, transmit an electrical impulse along the axon—or don’t fire. There is no in-between stage, just as pulling harder on a gun 
trigger doesn’t make the bullet travel faster
 
 ![alt text](fire.PNG)

- **Action Potential** an electric nerve impulse that travels through a neuron’s axon when it is set off by a “trigger,” changing the neuron’s 
charge from negative to positive. Movement of an action potential along an axon. Just before Time 1, positively charged ions enter the cell membrane, changing the charge in the nearby part of the axon from negative to positive and triggering an action potential. The action potential travels along the axon, as illustrated in the changes occurring from Time 1 to Time 3 (from top to bottom in this drawing). Immediately after the action potential has passed through a section of the axon, positive ions are pumped out, restoring the charge in that section to negative.

- Just after an action potential has passed through a section of the axon, the cell 
membrane in that region cannot admit positive ions again for a few milliseconds, 
and so a neuron cannot fi re again immediately no matter how much stimulation it 
receives.

- Axons with small diameters carry impulses at about 2 miles per hour; longer and thicker ones can average speeds of more than 225 miles per hour.

- Some neurons are capable of firing as many as 1,000 times per second; others fi re at much slower rates. The intensity of a stimulus determines how much of a neuron’s potential fi ring rate is reached. A strong stimulus, such as a bright light or a loud sound, leads to a higher rate of 
firing than a less intense stimulus does 

- **Mirror neurons** Specialized neurons that fire not only when a person enacts a particular behavior, but also when a person simply observes anotherindividual carrying out the same 
behavior. 
-  **synapse** The space between two neurons where the axon of a sending neuron communicates with the dendrites of a receiving neuron by using chemical messages. 

-  **Neurotransmitters** Chemicals that carry messages across the synapse to 
the dendrite (and sometimes the cell body) of a receiver neuron

 ![alt text](synapse.PNG)

- Several types of neurotransmitters, and not all neurons are capable of receiving the chemical message carried by a particular neurotransmitter. In the same way that a jigsaw puzzle piece can fit in only one specifi c location in a puzzle, each kind of neurotransmitter has a distinctive configuration that allows it to fi t into a specific type of receptor site on the receiving neuron

- If a neurotransmitter does fit into a site on the receiving neuron, the chemical 
message it delivers is basically one of two types: excitatory or inhibitory

-  **Excitatory message** A chemical message that makes it more likely that a receiving neuron will fire and an action potential will travel down its axon.

- **Inhibitory message** A chemical message that prevents or decreases the likelihood that a receiving neuron will fire.

- If neurotransmitters remained at the site of the synapse, receiving neurons would 
be awash in a continual chemical bath, producing constant stimulation or constant 
inhibition of the receiving neurons—and effective communication across the synapse 
would no longer be possible. To solve this problem, neurotransmitters are either 
deactivated by enzymes or—more commonly—reabsorbed by the terminal button in 
an example of chemical recycling called **reuptake** .

- Some antidepressant drugs, called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , permit certain neurotransmitters to remain active for a longer period at certain synapses in the brain, thereby reducing the symptoms of depression

 ![alt text](neurotransmitters.PNG)

- **Parkinson’s disease**, from which actor Michael J. Fox suffers, is caused by a defi ciency of dopamine in the brain.

- **over production of dopamine** produces negative consequences. 
For example, researchers have hypothesized that schizophrenia and some other 
severe mental disturbances are affected or perhaps even caused by the presence of 
unusually high levels of dopamine. Drugs that block the reception of dopamine 
reduce the symptoms displayed by some people diagnosed with schizophrenia

- Endorphins also may produce the euphoric feelings that runners sometimes 
experience after long runs. The exertion and perhaps the pain involved in a long run 
may stimulate the production of endorphins, ultimately resulting in what has been 
called **“runner’s high”**

- Endorphin release might also explain other phenomena that have long puzzled 
psychologists. For example, the act of taking placebos (pills or other substances that 
contain no actual drugs but that patients believe will make them better) may induce 
the release of endorphins, leading to the reduction of pain

### Central and Peripheral Nervous System

- **Central nervous system (CNS)** The part of the nervous system that includes the brain and spinal cord. 
 
- **Spinal cord** A bundle of neurons that leaves the brain and runs down the length of the back and is the main means for transmitting messages between the brain and the body.

- `Example:` The spinal cord is not just a communication channel. It also controls some simple behaviors on its own, without any help from the brain. An example is the way the knee jerks forward when it is tapped with a rubber hammer. This behavior is a type of refl ex , an automatic, involuntary response to an incoming 
stimulus. A refl ex is also at work when you touch a hot stove and immediately withdraw your hand. Although the brain eventually analyzes and reacts to the situation (“Ouch—hot stove—pull away!”), the initial withdrawal is directed only by neurons in the spinal cord.

- **Reflex** An automatic, involuntary response to an incoming stimulus.

 ![alt text](ns.PNG)

 
- **Sensory (afferent) neurons** Neurons that transmit information from the perimeter of the body to the central nervous system. 

- **Motor (efferent) neurons** Neurons that communicate information from the nervous system to muscles and glands. 
- **Interneurons** Neurons that connect sensory and motor neurons, carrying messages between the two. 

- **Peripheral nervous system** The part of the nervous system that includes the autonomic and somatic subdivisions; made up of neurons with long axons and dendrites, it branches out from the 
spinal cord and brain and reaches the extremities of the body. 

- **Somatic division** The part of the peripheral nervous system that specializes in the control of voluntary movements and the communication of information to and from the sense organs. 

- **Autonomic division** The part of the peripheral nervous system that controls involuntary movement of the heart, glands, lungs, and other organs. 

- **Sympathetic division** The part of the autonomic division of the nervous system that acts to prepare the body for action in stressful situations, engaging all the organism’s resources to 
respond to a threat. 

-  **Parasympathetic division** The part of the autonomic division of the nervous system that acts to calm the body after an emergency has ended. 

- **Physiological changes that occur during a crisis** `Example:`Page 126 Understanding Psychology
  


 ![alt text](acts.PNG)


   
  - **Evolution of Nervous System**The complexities of the nervous system can be better understood if we take the course of evolution into consideration. The forerunner of the human nervous system 
is found in the earliest simple organisms to have a spinal cord. Basically, those organisms were simple input-output devices: When the upper side of the spinal cord was 
stimulated by, for instance, being touched, the organism reacted with a simple 
response, such as jerking away. Such responses were completely a consequence of 
the organism’s genetic makeup. 
 Over millions of years, the spinal cord became more specialized, and organisms 
became capable of distinguishing between different kinds of stimuli and responding 
appropriately to them. Ultimately, a portion of the spinal cord evolved into what we 
would consider a primitive brain. 
 Today, the nervous system is hierarchically organized, meaning that relatively 
newer (from an evolutionary point of view) and more sophisticated regions of the 
brain regulate the older, and more primitive, parts of the nervous system. As we 
move up along the spinal cord and continue upward into the brain, then, the functions controlled by the various regions become progressively more advanced

- **Evolutionary psychology** The branch of psychology that seeks to identify behavior patterns that are a result of our genetic inheritance from our ancestors. 

- **Behavioral genetics** The study of the effects of heredity on behavior. 

- **Behavioral genetics lies at the heart of the nature-nurture question**, one of the key 
issues in the study of psychology. Although no one would argue that our behavior is 
determined solely by inherited factors, evidence collected by behavioral geneticists 
does suggest that our genetic inheritance predisposes us to respond in particular ways 
to our environment, and even to seek out particular kinds of environments. For 
instance, research indicates that genetic factors may be related to such diverse behaviors as level of family conflict, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, and general sociability.(`Page 128: Understanding Psychology`)

- **Controversy: Behavioral genetics**For instance, questions about the existence of genetic 
infl uences on criminality, intelligence, and homosexuality raise considerable emotion. 
Furthermore, it is unclear what the social and political consequences of discoveries 
in behavioral genetics would be. Would finding a strong genetic basis for criminal 
behavior lead to genetic screening and restricted civil rights for individuals having 
“criminal” genes? Clearly, behavioral genetic discoveries could have an impact on a 
number of important social issues.

 - **Gene therapy** , scientists inject into a patient’s bloodstream genes meant to cure a particular disease. When the genes arrive at the site of defective genes that are producing the 
illness, they trigger the production of chemicals that can treat the disease.
- `Example:`  Gene therapy is now being used in experimental trials involving people with certain forms of cancer and blindnes
-  **Genetic counseling**. Genetic counselors help people deal with issues related to inherited disorders. For example, genetic counselors provide advice to prospective parents about the potential risks in a future pregnancy, based on their family history of birth defects and hereditary illnesses. 
 


### Endocrine System

- **Endocrine system** A chemical communication network that sends messages throughout the body via the bloodstream.
- **Hormones Chemicals** that circulate through the blood and regulate the functioning or growth of the body. 
- Although the endocrine system is not part of the brain, it is closely linked to the hypothalamus.

- Neural messages move through neurons in specific lines (like a signal carried by wires strung along telephone poles), whereas hormones travel throughout the body, similar to the way radio waves are transmitted across the entire landscape. Just as radio waves evoke a response only when a 
radio is tuned to the correct station, hormones flowing through the bloodstream 
activate only those cells that are receptive and “tuned” to the appropriate hormonal 
message. 

- **Pituitary gland** The major component of the endocrine system, or “master gland,” which secretes hormones that control growth and other parts of the endocrine system. It is 
found near—and regulated by—the hypothalamus.  called the “master gland” because it controls the functioning of the rest of the endocrine system.
<br/> 
`Example` 
hormones secreted by the pituitary gland control growth. Extremely short people and unusually 
tall ones usually have pituitary gland abnormalities.

## PART 3

### Sensation and Perception

### Section 1: Vision
#### `Main Notes`
- Super Recognition and Faceblindness are disorders
- **Sensation** Encompasses the processes through which our sense organs recieve information from the world around them.
- **Perception** is sorting,organization,analysis,interpretation and integration of that information by our sense organs and brain.
- Difference between sensation and perception is : Sensation is the first encounter of organism with raw sensory stimulus and perception is the process through which it analyzes, interprets and integrates that stimulus with other sensory information.
- **Stimulus** is any passing source of energy that produces a response in a sense organ.
- **Psychophysics** is the branch of psychology that studies the relationship between physical aspects of stimulus and our psychological experience of them.
- **Absolute Threshold** is the smallest intensity(amount) of a stimulus that must be present for it to be detected.Technically absolute threshold is a the intensity of a stimulus that can be detected 50% of the time.
- **Noise** as defined by psychophysicists is background stimulation that interferes with detection of other stimuli.(Unwanted Stimulus.Encompasses all the stimulus)
- **Difference Threshold**`(also called Just Noticeable difference)` The smallest intensity of added or reduced stimuli that makes it possible to detect that a change in the stimulus has occured.
- **Webers,s Law**`(Page 104: Understanding Psychology)`The just noticable difference is a constant proportion to the intensity of initial stimulus. 
- **Adaption** An adjustment in sensory capacity after prolonged exposure to unchanging stimuli
- **Visual Spectrum** Range of Wavelength that human beings are sensitive to.It is relatively small.
- **Accomodation** Lens changes its thickness to focus light on the back of the eye.
- **Retina** is the part of eye that converts light enery to electrical Impulses to be transmitted to the brain.
- **Rods** Thin cyclindrical receptor cells in the retina that are highly sensitive to Light.It is related to dim vision.Insensitive to color and detail.It is responsible for **peripheral Vision** Recognizing Objects that are outside of main focus. 
- **Cones** Cone shaped light sensitive receptor cells inside the retina that are responsible for focus and color  particularly in bright lights.Cones are concentrated on the part of retina called **Fovea**.Fovea is particularly sensitive.When you focus on a particular object of interest the image is centered on fovea to see it more sharply. 
- **Dark Adaptation** Processes of adapting to dim light after being in a bright light enviroment.Cones and rods are involved in it. **Light adaption** opposite of dark adaptation.These processes occur as a result of rate of change in chemical composition in Rods and cones.Because change in rods take 20 to 30 minutes to reach maximum level ,Dark adaptation takes longer.While cones reach maximum level in a minute or so. 

 ![alt text](eye.PNG)


- **Optic Nerve** A bundle of `ganglion` axons that carry visual information to the brain.
- **Bipolar Cells** Inside Retina.Recieve from rods or cones , transmit to ganglion cells.
- **Ganglion Cells** Collect and summarize visual Information and then send it to the brain.Detect maximum light and darkness variation in the light.(`page 162:UP`)
- **Blind Spot** The opening of the optic nerve passes through the retina there are no rods or cones in that area so it creates a blind spot.
- **Optic Chiasm** Optic nerves from the 2 eyes meet at a specific point where `each optic` never then splits.

 ![alt text](split.PNG)

- David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel won the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their discovery that 
many neurons in the cortex are extraordinarily specialized.**Feature Detection** The activation of Neurons in Visual  Cortex by visual stimuli of specific shapes or patterns.Some cells are only activated by moving as opposed to stationary objects others by lines of diff shape ,width or orientation.
- Diff parts of brain process nerve impulses in several diff individual systems.
- **Ocular Dominance columns** Our brains process information coming from the 2 eyes seperatly, creating what is ODC.
- A normal Person is capable of distinguishing no less than 7 million colors.
- Approximatly 7 % men and 4 % women  are **color blind**. For most people with color blindness red fire appears yellow,Green grass seems yellow,Three colors of traffic light all appear yellow.
- Different types of color blindness , unable to differentiate between blue- Yellow.or all red,green seems yellow.In extreme cases ,no perception of color.Vision is like black and white tv.
- **Afterimage** Activity in the retina continues even when you are no longer looking at the original object.
- **Theories of Color Vision:**
  1. **Trichromatic theory of color vision:** Proposed by thomas young in the first half of 1800s.According to the theory retina contains 3 types of cones which are sensitive to specific wavelengths. One to yellow-red,one to green, one to blue-violet.According to the theory perception of color by the strength with which these cones are activated when they come in contact with light.
  **Example:** When looking at blue sky.Blue-violet cones are primarily activated and the other less so.
  **Issues:** It does not explain why the after image afterstaring at a yellow for one minute appears red.

  2. **Opponent Process Theory of color vision:** Proposed by Ewald hering in 19th century.Proposes that receptor cells are linked in pairs.Working in opposition.Pairs are Blue-Yellow, Red-Green and black-white.When an image contains more yellow than blue.Yellow receptors are activated and vice versa.
  **AfterImage Problem** It explains that after staring at a yellow page for long the yellow receptor cells become fatigued and are not able to respond well to new stimuli.However the paired blue cells are capable of responding because they have not been stimulated.So when you shift to white paper after staring at a yellow page for 1 minute.The Blue receptors are activated and respond and yellow cells being fatigued do not respond.Consequently, Blue color is seen in the after image.However the afterimage lasts only a while because the fatigue of yellow cells is quickly overcome.

  



#### `Thoughts`
```
- if our ears were more sensitive that they already are it would be problem matic because of we would be able to hear the sound of air molecules knocking into ear drum.
- Webers Law, According to him the difference threshold for weight is 1:50.It means that 1 ounce of weight change in an item of 50 ounces weight would be just noticable.It explains why a person sitting in a quiet room is more startled  by phone ringing than a person sitting in a noisy room.
- Webers Law hold for every kind of stimulus
- Pupil contraction in bright light allows us to see object at a greater distance in Fpcus.If pupil were to expand and let in all the light than our ability to see objects at a greater detail at distance would be reduced.
- Len becomes flatter when viewing distant objects and rounder when viewing objects at a closer distance.
- We never notice the blind spot because the information is automatically filled by  using nearby materials to compensate for the missing information.

#### `Summary`


### Section 1: Hearing and Other Senses
#### `Main Notes`
- Sound The Motion of air molecules brought about by a source of vibration
- The part of ear that vibrates when sound waves strike it
- A coiled tube in the ear filled with liquid that vibrates in response to sound waves.
- Basilar membrane A vibrating structure that lies inside the cochlea and divides it into upper and lower chamber with sound receptor cells attached to it.
- Process of Hearing: Sound enters out Ear ==> Strikes Ear drum .Transmit vibrations to middle ear==> Middle ear contains hammer,anvil and stirrup.They transmit and amplify vibrations through the oval window.It reaches inner ear ==> Inner ear contains Cochlea inside it is basilar membrane.(`Page 169:UP`)When vibrations bend hair cells on the basilar membrane neural Messages are sent to brain.
- Hair cells attached to the basilar membrane when bent due to sound send neural messages to the br ain. 
- Frequency is the number of wave cycles that occur in a second.
- Pitch is the characteristic that makes sound appear high or low.Low frequency translates into low pitched sound.Lowest pitch detectable by humans 20 decibels.Highest 20,000.When sound gets higher than 120 decibels it becomes painful to ear.Our hearing capacity diminishes as we age especially for high pitched sounds.`Thats why older people often cannot hear low pitched sounds`.
- Amplitude is the feature of waves that allow us to determine whether sound is loud or soft.Waves with `small peaks and valleys are soft and vice versa`.
- Place theory of Hearing States that different part of the basilar membrance respond to different frequencies.
  **Issues** Doesnt tell the whole story.Low frequency sounds trigger neurons basilar membrane over such a large area that no single point can be specified.
- Frequency theory of Hearing states that basilar membrane acts like a microphone responding as a whole to frequencies.The higher the pitch the greater the number of neural impulses to the brain
  **Issues** Both theories do not fully explain the process of hearing.Place theory provides a better explaination for higher frequencies while frequency theory for lower frequencies.
- Semicircular canal 3 tubelike structures with fluid inside them that sloshes around when the head is moved signaling rotational or angular movement of brain.
- Otholiths semi cicular crystals in side the semicircular canal which detect the pull of gravity ,accelation and movement.When we move otholiths shift like sand in wind and come in contact with hair cells.
- Human sense of smell(olfaction) allows us to distinguish between 10,000 smells.Women general have better sense of smell.People can distinguish gender base on smell alone.
- We smell when air molecules of some object interact with nasal receptor cells present inside our nose.Smell may also act as a secretive means of communication.Non humans use phermones to communicate sexual attraction or availability.
- Gustation(Sense of Taste) involves receptor cells that respond to basic 4 stimulus qualities : salty,Sweet,sour and bitter.There is a fifth one but debatable its called umami meaning meaty or savoury.Its japanes.Every taste is a simple combination of these basic 4.Like colors.Receptor cells are roughly 10,000.They wear out and are replaced every 10 days.If this did not happen we would lose our sense of taste if we accidently burned our tongue.Some people are super tasters with twice as many receptors on tongue as non tasters.
- Skin senses are touch,pressure, temperature and pain.
- Women experience pain more intensely than men.It may depend on the situation along with mental state,Experience and background of the individual.Soldiers after being hurt have a diminished because they are at a relief that they are alive.
- Gate control theory of Pain states that receptor cells in the spinal cord lead to certain areas in brain related to pain.When body is injured and these receptor cells become activate.A gate way is opened to the brain and we experience the sensation of pain.
  2 ways that this gateway  can be closed or diminished in some sense.
  1.  Other Impulses  than pain can overwhelm or compete for the path to brain and closing the gate.Hence ending the pain sensation.THis is one of reason rubbing around the area of injury than reduce pain.
  2.  Psychological factors can diminish pain such as soldier at relief of being alive.
- Strategies to Fight Pain:
    1. Medication
    2. Nerve and Brain stimulation .Passing current through nerve or centain parts of brain
    3. Light therapy.Exposure to lights of certan wavelengths results in pain reduction
    4. Hypnosis 
    5. BioFeedback and relaxation: Biofeedback is learning to control involuntary functions of body like heart beat.
    6. surgery: cutting the nerve pathway.
    7. Cognitive Restructuring : Thinking positively

#### `Thoughts`
```
- Left ear reacts more to speech while right ear reacts more to music.
- Gate pain theory explains the pain relieving method of acupunture and why it works .The needle may block the gateway to the brain , lessening the experience of pain.

#### `Questions`
1. `How are our brains able to sort out wavelengths of different frequencies and intensities?`(Part of basilar membrane neart to the oval window is most sensitive to high frequency sounds,Cochleas inner end is most sensitive to low frequency.So this explaination supports Place theory. )
2. Why does space sickness occur ? Due to weightless ness of otholiths.
3. Do humans communicate through smell ? 
4. Why do non tasters seek out relatively sweet foods as compared to super tasters ? less receptor cells.
5. `What are the causes for synesthesia ?` Possible explainations: Dense neural networks between different sensory areas of brain or lack of neural control that inhibits connection between sensory areas.

### Section 2: Perceptual Organization: Constructing Our View of the World
#### `Main Notes`
- **Gestalt Law of Organization** Some of the basic sensory processes can be described by the way we organize bits and pieces of information into meaningful wholes.Set forth in ear `1900s`.Some of the principles are close,proximity, similarity and simplicity.
 ![alt text](gestalts.PNG)
**Contemporary** Gestaltk psychology no longer play a prominant role in modern psychology but one principle that still retains its relevance is that two objects considered together form a whole different than the simple combination of singular objects. 
- **Ways of Processing**
- **Top down Processing(tdp)** Perception that is guided by high level known, experience and expectations. We try to see the whole picture instead of singular instances.Thats why you can understand words that might have some letters missing.Such as `Helo,l-tt-r,ev-ry`. Top down processing allows us to fill in gaps and  make sense of missing information.Top down processing cannot occur on its own.Bottom up processing is required. If we did not know the meaning of individual words it would be impossible to make sense of sentences that might be missing some words.
- **Bottom up Processing(bup)** Process of recognizing and processing information from individual bits and moving towards the perception of the whole.BUP and TDP occur simuntaniously .Context is very important in TDP.
- **Depth Perception** The Ability to view the world in 3 dimentional plane and perceive distance.
- **Binocular disparity** The difference between the images seen by the left and the right eye.In some cases particular cues allow us to percieve depth and distance. Through a single eye called **monocular cues** Like motion parallax.
- **Monocular cues** `Relative size`. Experience taught us that object of same size but making images of different size on the retina tell us that the object with small image is farther away.`Texture Gradient` tells us about the distance because the details of object that are far away are less distinct.`Linear Perspective` Like railway tracks in the distance.Far away objects appear to be closer to each other than objects that are not distant.
- **Perceptual Constancy** Perception of objects is unvarying and consistant even if their appearance or enviroment changes. Like person moving away from us.His size shrinks but we undstand them to be the same.It can sometimes mislead us.Like moon above the sky is perceived smaller and distant while moon appearing close to the horizon appears huge and closer.(`Page 185:UP`)
- **Apparant Movement** The perception that a stationary object is moving. Like sitting in stationary state you something think that it has started moving when infact it hasn't.
- **Perception of motion** Movement of the objects image on our retina.But its alway not the cases.Otherwise we would always consider the world at motion when we move our head.
- **Visual Illusions** Physical stimuli that consistantly produce error in perception.
- **Muller Lyer Illusion** `page 186:UP` 2 lines of equal length. One line with arrow tip pointed inward appears longer than the line with arrow tip pointed outward.One explaination is when tip is inward the eye movements are greater percieving it to be longer.

- **Devil tuning Folk** Problematice for people brought up in western world to reproduce because they perceive objects in 3D while people brought up in zulu culture can reproduct it easily.Cultural differences are reflected in depth perception
- **Subliminal Perception** Perceiving minor cues that we are not aware of.They do affect our behaviour.Such descriptive label called **prime** shown to a subject really fast before he can register it about some person and he forms an opinion based on that label such as happy or smart.
- Subliminal messages are called `priming`.Little evidence to prove that it leads to major changes.Thirst and coca cola example on it.`188:IP`.
- **ESP** Extra sensory perception.Scientists are skeptical of it.It involves perceiving information with out using our senses.Example mind reading,clarvoyance.

#### `Questions`
- What principles underlie organization of the visual world and allow us to make sense of the world ?
- How are we able to sense the world in 3D when our retina are only capable of sensing on 2-D Images ?
- What clues do illusions give us about our understanding of general perceptual mechanisms ?
- Why top down processing cannot occur on its own ?
- How does tdp and bup occur ?
- `How do we make transformation from 2d to 3d  and Percieve distance?` There is a distance between the 2 eyes and so the images reach each eye are different.The brain integrates that images into one.It also recognizes the difference in the images and uses that difference to determine the distance of an object.E.g Pencil at arm length example.(`Page 183:UP`)
- Why does perceptual constancy problem in moon viewing occurs ? Explain
