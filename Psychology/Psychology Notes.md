### Definition and scope

- Psychology is the scientific study of Behaviour and Mental Processes. Behaviour and Mental Processes doesnt only involve what humans do and think but rather perception,emotions,reasonining processes and even biological processes that maintain the body.

- Behaviour Neuroscience is a subfield of psychology that deals with how brain, the nervous system and other biological processes determine behaviour.Like certain areas of brain causing tremors in muscles of those suffereing from parkinson,s disease.

- Experimental Psychology deals with sensing,percieving, learning and thinking about the world.
    - Sub Specialy of Experimental Psychology:
    1. Cognitive Psychology : It involves higher mental processes like thinking,Memory, Decision making, judging, Problem solving and language .Like a cognitive pstchology might be interested in what a victim of a plane crash might remember about their experience.

- Developmental Psychology studies how a person grows from the point of conception to death.
- Personality Psychology studies how a person changes over a course of time and what traits are consist in his personality.Moreover,it also deals with the traits that differentiate one person from another.

### Psychology as a Science

### Schools of thought and Perspective
- Seven thousand years ago, people assumed that psychological problems were caused by 
evil spirits. To allow those spirits to escape from a person’s body, ancient healers chipped 
a hole in a patient’s skull with crude instruments—a procedure called **trephining** . 
- **Tabula Rasa** John locke a british philosopher of 17 century believed that children were born into this world with blank slates `(Tabula Rasa)`.
- **Structuralism** Wilhem wundt,s approach which deals with uncovering fundamental mental components of consciousness ,thinking,perception and emotions along with other mental tasks.
- 
- **Introspection** A procedure used by Wilhem wundt to understand how basic sensory processes build our understanding of the world.They presented people with a stimulus—such as a bright green object or a sentence printed on a card—and asked them to describe, in their own words and in as much detail as they could, what they were experiencing. Wundt argued that by analyzing people’s 
reports, psychologists could come to a better understanding of the structure of the mind.


- **Functionalism** The perspective that replaced structuralism is known as functionalism. Rather 
than focusing on the mind’s structure, functionalism concentrated on what the mind 
does and how behavior functions.Functionalists, whose perspective became prominent in the early 1900s, asked what role behavior plays in allowing people to adapt 
to their environments. For example, a functionalist might examine the function of 
the emotion of fear in preparing us to deal with emergency situations. 

- The American educator John Dewey drew  on functionalism to develop the fi eld of school psychology, proposing ways to best meet students’ educational needs. 

- **Gestalt Psychology** Another important reaction to structuralism was the development of gestalt 
psychology in the early 1900s. Gestalt psychology emphasizes how perception is 
organized. Instead of considering the individual parts that make up thinking, gestalt 
psychologists took the opposite tack, studying how people consider individual 
elements together as units or wholes. Led by German scientists such as Hermann 
Ebbinghaus and Max Wertheimer, gestalt psychologists proposed that “The whole is 
different from the sum of its parts,” meaning that our perception, or understanding, 
of objects is greater and more meaningful than the individual elements that make up 
our perceptions.

- **Womens contribution to Psychology** Despite the hurdles they faced, women made notable contributions to psychology,  although their impact on the field was largely overlooked until recently. 
For example, 
Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to receive a doctorate in 
psychology, and she did important work on animal behavior. Leta Stetter Hollingworth 
(1886–1939) was one of the fi rst psychologists to focus on child development and on 
women’s issues. She collected data to refute the view, popular in the early 1900s, that 
women’s abilities periodically declined during parts of the menstrual cycle.y. Anna Freud (1895–1982), the daughter of Sigmund Freud, 
also made notable contributions to the treatment of abnormal behavior,


### Recent Trends and Models of Psychology

- For Recent trends must go thorough page 73 and 74 of Understanding Psychology by Feldman
  Total 5 modern perspectives:

  1.  **Neuroscience perspective** The approach  that views behavior from the perspective of the brain, the nervous system, and other biological functions. 
  2.  **Psychodynamic perspective** The approach based on the view that behavior is motivated by unconscious inner forces over which the individual has little control.
  3.  **Behavioral perspective** The approach that suggests that observable, measurable behavior should be the focus of study.
  4.  **cognitive perspective** The approach that focuses on how people think, understand, and know about the world.
  5.   **Humanistic perspective** The approach that suggests that all individuals naturally strive to grow, develop, and be in control of their lives and behavior. 

- Point of Contention and Debate in the Psychology
-  Nature(Hereditary) vs Nurture( Enviromental Influences)
-  Concious vs unconcious behaviour
-  Free will vs determinism
-  Observable vs Internal processes and behaviours
-  Individual DIfferences(Unique personality) vs universal Principles(Product of culture and society)

## Part 2

### Nervous System , Neuron and its function

- **BioPsychologists or Behavioural Neuroscientists** Psychologists who specialize in how biology and body functions determine or effect behaviour.
- Around 1 trillion neurons in a human brain
- **Dendrite** A cluster of fi bers at one end  of a neuron that receives messages from other neurons.
- **Axon** The part of the neuron that carries messages destined for other neurons. 
-  **Terminal buttons** Small bulges at the end of axons that send messages to other neurons. 
-   **Myelin sheath** A protective coat of fat and protein that wraps around the axon.myelin sheath also serves to increase the velocity with which electrical impulses travel through axons. Those axons that carry the most important and most urgently required information have the greatest concentrations of myelin. If your hand touches a painfully hot stove, for example, the information regarding the pain is passed through axons in the hand and arm that have a relatively thick 
coating of myelin, speeding the message of pain to the brain so that you can react 
instantly.  

 **all-or-none law** The rule that neurons are either on or off.
  
  ![alt text](neurons.PNG)

**resting state** The state in which there is a negative electrical charge of about –70 millivolts within a neuron.Also  Like a gun, neurons either fire—that is, transmit an electrical impulse along the axon—or don’t fire. There is no in-between stage, just as pulling harder on a gun 
trigger doesn’t make the bullet travel faster
 
 ![alt text](fire.PNG)

- **Action Potential** an electric nerve impulse that travels through a neuron’s axon when it is set off by a “trigger,” changing the neuron’s 
charge from negative to positive. Movement of an action potential along an axon. Just before Time 1, positively charged ions enter the cell membrane, changing the charge in the nearby part of the axon from negative to positive and triggering an action potential. The action potential travels along the axon, as illustrated in the changes occurring from Time 1 to Time 3 (from top to bottom in this drawing). Immediately after the action potential has passed through a section of the axon, positive ions are pumped out, restoring the charge in that section to negative.

- Just after an action potential has passed through a section of the axon, the cell 
membrane in that region cannot admit positive ions again for a few milliseconds, 
and so a neuron cannot fi re again immediately no matter how much stimulation it 
receives.

- Axons with small diameters carry impulses at about 2 miles per hour; longer and thicker ones can average speeds of more than 225 miles per hour.

- Some neurons are capable of firing as many as 1,000 times per second; others fi re at much slower rates. The intensity of a stimulus determines how much of a neuron’s potential fi ring rate is reached. A strong stimulus, such as a bright light or a loud sound, leads to a higher rate of 
firing than a less intense stimulus does 

- **Mirror neurons** Specialized neurons that fire not only when a person enacts a particular behavior, but also when a person simply observes anotherindividual carrying out the same 
behavior. 
-  **synapse** The space between two neurons where the axon of a sending neuron communicates with the dendrites of a receiving neuron by using chemical messages. 

-  **Neurotransmitters** Chemicals that carry messages across the synapse to 
the dendrite (and sometimes the cell body) of a receiver neuron

 ![alt text](synapse.PNG)

- Several types of neurotransmitters, and not all neurons are capable of receiving the chemical message carried by a particular neurotransmitter. In the same way that a jigsaw puzzle piece can fit in only one specifi c location in a puzzle, each kind of neurotransmitter has a distinctive configuration that allows it to fi t into a specific type of receptor site on the receiving neuron

- If a neurotransmitter does fit into a site on the receiving neuron, the chemical 
message it delivers is basically one of two types: excitatory or inhibitory

-  **Excitatory message** A chemical message that makes it more likely that a receiving neuron will fire and an action potential will travel down its axon.

- **Inhibitory message** A chemical message that prevents or decreases the likelihood that a receiving neuron will fire.

- If neurotransmitters remained at the site of the synapse, receiving neurons would 
be awash in a continual chemical bath, producing constant stimulation or constant 
inhibition of the receiving neurons—and effective communication across the synapse 
would no longer be possible. To solve this problem, neurotransmitters are either 
deactivated by enzymes or—more commonly—reabsorbed by the terminal button in 
an example of chemical recycling called **reuptake** .

- Some antidepressant drugs, called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , permit certain neurotransmitters to remain active for a longer period at certain synapses in the brain, thereby reducing the symptoms of depression

 ![alt text](neurotransmitters.PNG)

- **Parkinson’s disease**, from which actor Michael J. Fox suffers, is caused by a defi ciency of dopamine in the brain.

- **over production of dopamine** produces negative consequences. 
For example, researchers have hypothesized that schizophrenia and some other 
severe mental disturbances are affected or perhaps even caused by the presence of 
unusually high levels of dopamine. Drugs that block the reception of dopamine 
reduce the symptoms displayed by some people diagnosed with schizophrenia

- Endorphins also may produce the euphoric feelings that runners sometimes 
experience after long runs. The exertion and perhaps the pain involved in a long run 
may stimulate the production of endorphins, ultimately resulting in what has been 
called **“runner’s high”**

- Endorphin release might also explain other phenomena that have long puzzled 
psychologists. For example, the act of taking placebos (pills or other substances that 
contain no actual drugs but that patients believe will make them better) may induce 
the release of endorphins, leading to the reduction of pain

### Central and Peripheral Nervous System

- **Central nervous system (CNS)** The part of the nervous system that includes the brain and spinal cord. 
 
- **Spinal cord** A bundle of neurons that leaves the brain and runs down the length of the back and is the main means for transmitting messages between the brain and the body.

- `Example:` The spinal cord is not just a communication channel. It also controls some simple behaviors on its own, without any help from the brain. An example is the way the knee jerks forward when it is tapped with a rubber hammer. This behavior is a type of refl ex , an automatic, involuntary response to an incoming 
stimulus. A refl ex is also at work when you touch a hot stove and immediately withdraw your hand. Although the brain eventually analyzes and reacts to the situation (“Ouch—hot stove—pull away!”), the initial withdrawal is directed only by neurons in the spinal cord.

- **Reflex** An automatic, involuntary response to an incoming stimulus.

- **Sensory (afferent) neurons** Neurons that transmit information from the perimeter of the body to the central nervous system. 

- **Motor (efferent) neurons** Neurons that communicate information from the nervous system to muscles and glands. 
- **Interneurons** Neurons that connect sensory and motor neurons, carrying messages between the two. 

- **Peripheral nervous system** The part of the nervous system that includes the autonomic and somatic subdivisions; made up of neurons with long axons and dendrites, it branches out from the 
spinal cord and brain and reaches the extremities of the body. 

- **Somatic division** The part of the peripheral nervous system that specializes in the control of voluntary movements and the communication of information to and from the sense organs. 

- **Autonomic division** The part of the peripheral nervous system that controls involuntary movement of the heart, glands, lungs, and other organs. 

- **Sympathetic division** The part of the autonomic division of the nervous system that acts to prepare the body for action in stressful situations, engaging all the organism’s resources to 
respond to a threat. 

-  **Parasympathetic division** The part of the autonomic division of the nervous system that acts to calm the body after an emergency has ended. 

- **Physiological changes that occur during a crisis** `Example:`Page 126 Understanding Psychology

  - **Evolution of Nervous System**The complexities of the nervous system can be better understood if we take the course of evolution into consideration. The forerunner of the human nervous system 
is found in the earliest simple organisms to have a spinal cord. Basically, those organisms were simple input-output devices: When the upper side of the spinal cord was 
stimulated by, for instance, being touched, the organism reacted with a simple 
response, such as jerking away. Such responses were completely a consequence of 
the organism’s genetic makeup. 
 Over millions of years, the spinal cord became more specialized, and organisms 
became capable of distinguishing between different kinds of stimuli and responding 
appropriately to them. Ultimately, a portion of the spinal cord evolved into what we 
would consider a primitive brain. 
 Today, the nervous system is hierarchically organized, meaning that relatively 
newer (from an evolutionary point of view) and more sophisticated regions of the 
brain regulate the older, and more primitive, parts of the nervous system. As we 
move up along the spinal cord and continue upward into the brain, then, the functions controlled by the various regions become progressively more advanced

- **Evolutionary psychology** The branch of psychology that seeks to identify behavior patterns that are a result of our genetic inheritance from our ancestors. 

- **Behavioral genetics** The study of the effects of heredity on behavior. 

- **Behavioral genetics lies at the heart of the nature-nurture question**, one of the key 
issues in the study of psychology. Although no one would argue that our behavior is 
determined solely by inherited factors, evidence collected by behavioral geneticists 
does suggest that our genetic inheritance predisposes us to respond in particular ways 
to our environment, and even to seek out particular kinds of environments. For 
instance, research indicates that genetic factors may be related to such diverse behaviors as level of family conflict, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, and general sociability.(`Page 128: Understanding Psychology`)

- **Controversy: Behavioral genetics**For instance, questions about the existence of genetic 
infl uences on criminality, intelligence, and homosexuality raise considerable emotion. 
Furthermore, it is unclear what the social and political consequences of discoveries 
in behavioral genetics would be. Would finding a strong genetic basis for criminal 
behavior lead to genetic screening and restricted civil rights for individuals having 
“criminal” genes? Clearly, behavioral genetic discoveries could have an impact on a 
number of important social issues.

 - **Gene therapy** , scientists inject into a patient’s bloodstream genes meant to cure a particular disease. When the genes arrive at the site of defective genes that are producing the 
illness, they trigger the production of chemicals that can treat the disease.
- `Example:`  Gene therapy is now being used in experimental trials involving people with certain forms of cancer and blindnes
-  **Genetic counseling**. Genetic counselors help people deal with issues related to inherited disorders. For example, genetic counselors provide advice to prospective parents about the potential risks in a future pregnancy, based on their family history of birth defects and hereditary illnesses. 
 


### Endocrine System

- **Endocrine system** A chemical communication network that sends messages throughout the body via the bloodstream.
- **Hormones Chemicals** that circulate through the blood and regulate the functioning or growth of the body. 
- Although the endocrine system is not part of the brain, it is closely linked to the hypothalamus.

- Neural messages move through neurons in specific lines (like a signal carried by wires strung along telephone poles), whereas hormones travel throughout the body, similar to the way radio waves are transmitted across the entire landscape. Just as radio waves evoke a response only when a 
radio is tuned to the correct station, hormones flowing through the bloodstream 
activate only those cells that are receptive and “tuned” to the appropriate hormonal 
message. 

- **Pituitary gland** The major component of the endocrine system, or “master gland,” which secretes hormones that control growth and other parts of the endocrine system. It is 
found near—and regulated by—the hypothalamus.  called the “master gland” because it controls the functioning of the rest of the endocrine system.
<br/> 
`Example` 
hormones secreted by the pituitary gland control growth. Extremely short people and unusually 
tall ones usually have pituitary gland abnormalities.

### Sensation and Perception

### Section 1
#### `Main Notes`
- Super Recognition and Faceblindness are disorders
- **Sensation** Encompasses the processes through which our sense organs recieve information from the world around them.
- **Perception** is sorting,organization,analysis,interpretation and integration of that information by our sense organs and brain.
- Difference between sensation and perception is : Sensation is the first encounter of organism with raw sensory stimulus and perception is the process through which it analyzes, interprets and integrates that stimulus with other sensory information.
