## PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

Psychological illness, psychological disorders, or mental illness are referred to as psychopathology.
•The term is used to describe abnormal behavior.
Psychopathology is the area of study in psychology that primarily focuses upon the origin, development and manifestation of behavioral and mental disorders.
Abnormal psychology is that branch of psychology that studies, describes, explains, and identifies abnormal behavior.
•The observable behavior and mental experiences of an individual may be indicative of a mental or psychological disorder. The overt behavior and other experiences provide cues to the development of mental or psychological disorders.
•Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists treat mental disorders.
•Besides, they are also interested in studying and conducting research on the nature and role of the events that cause these disorders e.g. past history of a person and other variables that contribute to mental illness.
### DEFINING ABNORMALITY
What is abnormal behavior?
Abnormality can be defined in a number of ways.
People identify, understand and explain abnormality according to their past experience, common information, cultural tradition, societal attitude, and/or professional knowledge. Definitions of Abnormal
Behavior
1. Statistical definition
People deviating from the norm are considered “abnormal”.
•BUT what if majority of people indulge into erratic behavior?
•What about the creative artists who did not go along the norm?
2. Abnormality as deviation from “Ideal” Ideal refers to the standard toward which most people strive.
• Abnormality, according to this definition, is not striving toward the ideal.
• BUT what about those for whom the ‘ideal’ is not the ‘ideal’?
• For example a student who is a very good painter and does not want to pursue conventional education.
3. A Sense of Personal Discomfort Seen As Abnormality
• A person is seen as abnormal if his thoughts and behavior are a source of discomfort for him.
• Discomfort can be in the form of anxiety, distress, or guilt.
4. Inability to function effectively
• People, who cannot function and perform as effectively as they ought to, are seen as abnormal.
• This definition includes adjusting, and adapting to the social requirements.
5. The Legal Definition of Abnormality
• Laws in different countries define abnormality according to their legal standards.
• It is primarily needed for differentiating sanity from insanity.
• Abnormality may be viewed as not being able to foresee and understand the consequences of the criminal act.
• Or it can be taken as inability to control one’s own thoughts and behaviors.
• Or it can be the ability to see right as different from wrong.
Perspectives on Abnormality
• Approaches to studying, describing, and understanding, explaining, and predicting abnormality.
• These approaches affect the way a mental patient will be treated.
PERSPECTIVES OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR
1. MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE
• Psychological problems are caused by physiological factors.
• These can be the biological processes and systems, genetic factors, the nervous system and the neurotransmitters, hormonal changes, or external variables affecting the biology of a person.
2. PSYCHODYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE• Childhood experiences are the root cause of mental disorders.
• Unconscious determinants are significant.
3. BEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE• Abnormal behavior is learned.
• Abnormality is a learned response.
• It results from our interaction with the external world.
4. COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE• The factors causing mental disorders are a person’s cognitions, thoughts, and beliefs.
5. HUMANISTIC PERSPECTIVE• People’s need to self-actualize, and their responsibility for their own actions, play a central role in abnormality behavior.
6. SOCIOCULTURAL PERSPECTIVE• The social milieu in which one lives, the family and the people around, the society, and the culture at large are of primary importance in the onset, and later treatment, of mental illness

CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL DISORDERS• Kraepelin gave the first classification system of mental disorders.
• A number of classification systems followed afterwards.
• The purpose was to assist the clinicians diagnose mental disorders, as well as to determine the extent of the problem.
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS• DSM- IV- TR
• ICD
DSM-IV-TR
• Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders is the classification system compiled by the American Psychiatric Association.
• This is the most widely used classification system all over the world.
ICD: INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION• For decades, mental health professionals in Western Europe and a major part of the world used this classification system.
• The World Health Organization developed ICD.
• ICD is a comprehensive classification system of all kinds of diseases, including psychological or psychiatric illnesses.
• For a number of years ICD9 remained a popular diagnostic system.
• Research, in the last more than a decade, reflected that the revised and improved versions of
DSM had an edge over ICD in many respects.
• Besides, there were no major differences as such in the two systems.
• Also, the need for a single universally accepted system was intensely felt.
• Therefore today DSM-IV-TR is recognized as a universally accepted diagnostic system.

DSM-IV-TR• The first DSM was published in 1917.
• It originated from a project of the American Medico-Psychological Association, now known as American psychiatric Association and United States Bureau of the Census.
• In order to collect uniform data on hospitalized mental patients, they developed a list of 59 mental illnesses.
• The list was further expanded with the publication of the first DSM in 1952.
• The first DSM included a list of 106 mental illnesses.
• DSM-II was published in 1968.
• DSM-III was published in 1980.
• DSM-III-R was published in 1987.
• DSM-IV was published in 1994.
• DSM-IV was developed after a special 27-member task force of experts worked for five years.
• More than 1000 psychiatrists contributed and advised in deciding about the diseases and other information to be included in DSM-IV.
• DSM-IV-TR was published in 2000.
DSM-IV-TR contains definitions of more than 200 mental disorders.
These disorders are organized into 17 major categories.
MULTI AXIAL SYSTEM OF DSM-IV-TR• DSM-IV-R also contains five axes, or five types of information, that have to be considered in the diagnosis of a patient.
Axes of DSM-IV-TR
• Axis I: Clinical disorders
• Axis II: Long standing problems that are frequently overlooked in the presence of disorders listed in axis mental retardation, personality disorder & I.
• Axis III: General medical conditions that may be relevant to a psychological disorder.
• Axis IV: Psychosocial or environmental problems that a person is facing.
• These problems may affect the diagnosis, treatment, or the course of the mental disorder.
• Axis V: Global Assessment Of Functioning.
MAJOR CATEGORIES OF DISORDERS IN DSM-IV-TR
1. Anxiety disorders
2. Somatoform disorders
3. Dissociative disorders
4. Mood disorders
5. Schizophrenia
6. Personality disorders
7. Sexual disorders

the creative output.
• The manics are often reckless and end up with self-injury.
Causes
Psychodynamic explanation: Feeling of loss that can be real or potential.
Hereditary factor: These disorders appear to be running in families.
The role of neurotransmitters: Serotonin and nor epinephrine have been found to be related to these
disorders.
Alterations in the level of these chemicals have a role to play in mood disorders
Behavioral explanation: Lack of, or reduction in, positive reinforcement leads to mood disorders.
Cognitive explanation: the sufferers of depression believe that they are life’s losers; they are failures,
inadequate, and not meant to be the ‘winners’ in life. They have a pessimistic view of life.
Evolutionary psychology explanation: Considering the impact of the genetic factors, it states that depression is an adaptive response to unattainable goals.
