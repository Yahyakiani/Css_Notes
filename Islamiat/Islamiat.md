# Notes


# Islam the Antiquated Religion ?

- Islam is not merely a set of moral ideals or philosophical notions.It is a code of life that encompasses every aspect of life. Principle regarding Social,Moral,Political and personal scope are the driving force making Islam a complete system.
- Modern world has cast of the old gods and submitted to a new God of Science. This cult of modern religion owes its allegiance only to personal Benefit and Profit.
- Humans are fighting one another for resources because science is confined to the material plane.Its spiritual facet is entirely hollow. Wealth and material goods are the highest ideal for individuals following this material tyrannical god.

- Why religion was rejected by the west ?
- Renaissance was a battle of dominion between the clergy and Scientists . People who suffered under the yoke of parochial tyranny rose against the church.

# Islam and Slavery

- It's misleading to use phrases such as 'Islamic slavery' and 'Muslim slave trade', even though slavery existed in many Muslim cultures at various times, since the Atlantic slave trade is not called the Christian slave trade, even though most of those responsible for it were Christians.
# Islam Moderated Slavery
- Islam greatly limited those who could be enslaved and under what circumstances
- Islam treated slaves as human beings instead of mere property
- Islam banned the mistreatment of slaves - indeed the tradition repeatedly stresses the importance of treating slaves with kindness and compassion
- Islam allowed slaves to achieve their freedom and made freeing slaves a virtuous act
- Islam barred Muslims from enslaving other Muslims


# Muslim slaves could achieve status

Slaves in the Islamic world were not always at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Slaves in Muslim societies had a greater range of work, and took on a wider range of responsibilities, than those enslaved in the Atlantic trade. SUch as Military service,
civil services,Learning trade and earning handsome incomes. Mamluk slave dynasty is an example of this phenonmenon.

# Muslim slavery was not just economic

Slaves were also taken for military service, some serving in elite corps essential to the ruler's control of the state, while others joined the equivalent of the civil service.


# How islam designation the institutions for Freedom of slaves

-  The Qur'anic verse describing the uses of poor-rate (Az-Zakat) says:
“Alms are only for the poor and the needy, and the officials (appointed) over them….,and
the (ransoming of) captives

- The great distinguishing feature of Islam that can hardly be looked for anywhere else, Islamic Government advanced to slaves such as would demand the writing of their freedom out of the Public Exchequer

-

#  comparison of Islam and other religions
- Almost all moral or religious revival movements prior to Islam emerged or developed as reaction.Taoism taught a corrupt and vice-ridden China to neglect material pleasure. Confucianism was opposed to these principles and called upon those who had retreated to monasteries to seek spiritual purification and individual piety to establish a virtuous state.asceticism grew as a reaction against the previously prevalent luxury and debauchery.

- Other religions Limited in their scope and teachings. For specific time, nations and their needs at that time.Jews for children of israel, Christianity was a continuation in judaism. Islam has set itself as universal religion encompassing teaching on every aspect of life.For all times to come till the day of judgement.


# Morality and Religion
- Morality as a principle does not exists without religion.It is born out of religion.Who to follow.Whims,desires.Only God can be followable entity.
- Morality was born by prohibition and has remained a prohibition until today.Out of the Ten Commandments, eight of them are prohibitions.
- From a historical point of view, moral thought is one of the oldest human thoughts.It has come intertwined with religion.
- Secular Ethical Movement freedom of morality from religion.Result: Depravity, Morals become slave to needs, Conflicting moral standards,

# Contemporary Problems in Islam and Islamic World
<h3>Forced-Conversion</h3>
- Pakistan: 1000 families were interview in sukkur and other parts of sindh. Parlimentary Commitee on forced conversions headed by Senator Anwarul Haq kakar did not find any evidence of direct coercion of Hindu girls but rather conversion was accomplished throgh a more nuanced and subtle manner factors which were related to Economic and social aspects.Economic and social marginalization were why some converted.

Quran :"There is no compulsion in religion."

<h3>fundamental tensions within Islam</h3>

<h4>Sectarian Violence</h4>

- Sectarian Violence within the islamic world.Which has rendered the islamic world hopelessly divided.Saudi Arabia maintains its guardianship of the shrines at Mecca and Medina against the claims of shia Iran,Shia traditions. No direct confrontation between the contemporaries but instead proxy wars.Its been reduced to a war of attrition.

“Saudi Arabia will fight until the last Pakistani,” goes the punchlines.
Battle in yemen between iran and coalition of Saudi Arabia.

<h4>between orthodox and heterodox claims to revelation and legitimacy</h4>
===================
<h4>Lack of Central Leadship</h4>

- Battle of Traditional and Modern interpretation of Islam.Leads to terrorism.Establishment of Islamic State.Under lying cause is economic decay and dearth


# Difference between Din and Religion

- Religion deals with private affairs of  life  whereas  Deen  covers  all  aspects  of  life,  individual  as  well  as collective.
- Deen  is  all  embracing  term  which  includes religio-socio-politico-economic  system.  It  touches  upon  the  material  as well  as  spiritual  dimensions  of  human  existence  and  insists  that  all  our thoughts and deeds should be performed with God consciousness.

“Today, I have completed your Deen, and have completed my bliss upon you and accepted for you Islam as a Deen.“

- Religion is an individual matter, but deen is a collective matter.
- Word religion  is  commonly  used  in  a  rather  narrow  sense,  its  scope  being limited  to  a  set  of  dogmas,  some  rituals  for  worship,  and  a  number  of social customs to celebrate important life-events

- In modern world , religion has been relegated to only a personal scope of an individual and it is not allowed to influence the working of a state in a collective sphere.This secularism.Islam is a DIn and diametrically opposite to this idea.


- How islam is different from other world religions:
- Other religions were specific to a set of limited people.While islam is for all the people of the world.
- Other religions were for a specific time while islam is till qayamat.
- Other religions focused only with the spiritual aspect of humanity such as Morality,beliefs and rituals.While islam encompasses all aspects of human life.
