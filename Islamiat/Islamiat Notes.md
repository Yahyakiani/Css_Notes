Intro to Islam
Concept of Islam
Meaning of Islam
-	Every religion of the world has been named either after its founder or after the community or nation in which it was born. For instance, Christianity takes its name from its prophet Jesus Christ; Buddhism from its founder, Gautama Buddha and Judaism, the religion of the Jews, from the name of the tribe Judah (of the country of Judea) where it originated.
-	The same is true of all other religions except Islam, which enjoys the unique distinction of having no such association with any particular person or people or country. Nor is it the product of any human mind. It is a universal religion, and its objective is to create and cultivate in man the quality and attitude of Islam.
-	Islam is an Arabic word and connotes submission, surrender and obedience. As a religion, Islam stands for complete submission and obedience to Allah. Another literal meaning of the word Islam is ‘peace’ and this signifies that one can achieve real peace of body and mind only through submission and obedience to Allah. Such a life of obedience brings with it peace of the heart and establishes real peace in society at large.
-	Everyone can see that we live in an orderly universe, where everything is assigned a place in a grand scheme. The moon, the stars and all the heavenly bodies are knit together in a magnificent system. They follow unalterable laws and make not even the slightest deviation from their ordained courses. Even in the human world the laws of nature are paramount. Man’s birth, growth and life are all regulated by a set of biological laws. In short, ours is a law-governed universe and everything in it is following the course that has been ordained for it.
-	This powerful, all-pervasive law, which governs all that comprises the universe, from the tiniest specks of dust to the magnificent galaxies of the heavens, is the law of God, the Creator and Ruler of the universe. As the whole of creation obeys the aw of God, the whole universe, therefore, literally follows the religion of Islam - for Islam signifies nothing but obedience and submission to Allah, the Lord of the Universe. The sun, the moon, the earth and all other heavenly bodies are thus ‘Muslim’. So are the air, water, heat, stones, trees and animals. Everything in the universe is ‘Muslim’ for it obeys God by submission to His laws. Even a man who refuses to believe in God, or offers his worship to someone other than Allah, has necessarily to be a ‘Muslim’ as far as his existence is concerned.
-	every tissue of his muscles and every limb of his body follows the course prescribed by God’s law. His very tongue which, on account of his ignorance advocates the denial of God or professes multiple deities, is in its very nature ‘Muslim’. His head which he wantonly bows to others besides Allah is born ‘Muslim’.
-	Let us now examine the situation from a different angle. Man is so constituted that there are two distinct spheres of his activity. One is the sphere in which he finds himself totally regulated by the Divine Law. Like other creatures, he is completely caught in the grip of the physical laws of nature and is bound to follow them. But there is another sphere of his activity. He has been endowed with reason and intellect. He has the power to think and form judgements, to choose and reject, to approve and spurn. He is free to adopt whatever course of life he chooses. In short, man has been bestowed with free will. Both these aspects co-exist side by side in man’s life.
-	In the first he, like all other creatures, is a born Muslim, invariably obeying the injunctions of God, and is bound to remain one. As far as the second aspect is concerned, he is free to become or not to become a Muslim. It is the way a person exercises this freedom which divides mankind into two groups: believers and non-believers. An individual who chooses to acknowledge his Creator, accepts Him as his real Master, honestly and scrupulously submits to His laws and injunctions and follows the code. He has achieved completeness in his Islam by consciously deciding to obey God in the domain in which he was endowed with freedom of choice. He is a perfect Muslim: his submission of his entire self to the will of Allah is Islam and nothing but Islam.
-	He has now consciously submitted to Him Whom he had already been unconsciously obeying. He has now willingly offered obedience to the Master Whom he already owed obedience to involuntarily. Now the whole of his existence is an embodiment of truth for, in all spheres of life, he voluntarily as well as involuntarily obeys the laws of One God - the Lord of the Universe. Now he is at peace with the whole universe for he worships Him Whom the whole universe worships. Such a man is God’s vice-regent on earth. The whole world is for him and he is for God.
The nature of Disbelief ‘Kufr’
-	Kufr literally means ‘to cover’ or ‘to conceal’. The man who denies God is called Kafir (concealer) because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul - for his nature is instinctively imbued with ‘Islam’.
-	Each and every particle of existence - living or lifeless - functions in accordance with ‘Islam’ and is fulfilling the duty that has been assigned to it. But the vision of this man has been blurred, his intellect has been befogged, and he is unable to see the obvious. His own nature has become concealed from his eyes and he thinks and acts in utter disregard of it. Reality becomes estranged from him and he gropes in the dark. Such is the nature of Kufr.
-	Kufr is a form of ignorance, or, rather, it is ignorance. What ignorance can be greater than to be ignorant of God, the Creator, the Lord of the Universe? He witnesses a superb plan in the universe - but fails to see the Planner behind it. He sees great beauty and harmony in its working - but not the Creator.
-	How can a man, who has so blinded himself to reality, approach true knowledge? How can one who has made the wrong beginning reach the right destination? He will fail to find the key to Reality. The Right Path will remain concealed for him and whatever his endeavours in science and arts, he will never be able to attain truth and wisdom. He will be groping in the darkness of ignorance.
-	Not only that; Kufr is a tyranny, the worst of all tyrannies. And what is ‘tyranny’? It is an unjust use of force or power. It is when you compel a thing to act unjustly or against its true nature, its real will and its inherent attitude.
-	Anyone who disobeys God and resorts to Kufr perpetrates the greatest injustice, for he uses his powers of body and mind to rebel against the course of nature and becomes an instrument in the drama of disobedience.
-	He uses his own powers and all those things over which he has authority against the explicit Will of God and thus establishes a reign of tyranny.
-	Do not think that by committing Kufr man does or can do the least harm to Almighty God. Man’s revolt against Him can do Him no harm; on the other hand, by his disobedience, man treads the path of ruin and disgrace.
-	Such a rebel will never find the thread of real knowledge and vision; for knowledge that fails to reveal its own Creator can reveal no truth. Such a man’s intellect and reason always run astray, for reason which errs about its own Creator cannot illumine the paths of life. Such a man will meet with failures in all the affairs of his life.
-	And in the life hereafter he will be held guilty for the crimes he committed against his nature. Every organ of his body - his brain, eyes, nose, hands and feet will complain against the injustice and cruelty he had subjected them to.
-	This is the inglorious consequence of Kufr. It leads to the blind alleys of utter failure, both here and hereafter.
Importance of Din in Human life

### Diff btw Din and Religion
### Islamic beliefs and its impact
### Faith/Iman
-	The Arabic word Iman, which we have rendered in English as faith, literally means ‘to know’, ‘to believe’ and ‘to be convinced beyond the least shadow of doubt’. Faith, thus, is firm belief arising out of knowledge and conviction. And the man who knows and reposes unshakable belief in the Unity of God, in His Attributes, in His Law and the Revealed Guidance, and in the Divine Code of Reward and Punishment is called Mu'min (faithful). This faith invariably leads man to a life of obedience and submission to the Will of God. And one who lives this life of submission is known as Muslim.
-	It is therefore clear that without faith (Iman) no man can be a true Muslim. It is the indispensable essential; rather, the very starting point, without which no beginning can be made.
-	The relation of Islam to Iman is the same as of a tree to its seed. As a tree cannot sprout forth without its seed, in the same way it is not possible for a man who has no belief to start with, to become a ‘Muslim’.
Tawheed
-	The basic principle of Islam is tawhid, the belief in the unity of Allah. It is a revolutionary concept, especially during the time when it was revealed, and the starting point of Islam. Belief in the oneness and unity of Allah is the essence of Islam and is espoused in the Articles of faith, and the Pillars of Islam. It means Allah has no partners in His dominion, no similarities with another, no rivals in His divinity and worship.
-	“There is no deity but Allah” (La- ilaha illallah). This beautiful phrase is the bedrock of Islam, its foundation and its essence. It is the expression of this belief which differentiates a true Muslim from a kafir (unbeliever), mushrik (one who associates others with God in His Divinity) or dahriyah (an atheist).
-	Obviously, the mere utterance of a phrase or two is not in itself important. The real difference lies in the conscious acceptance of this doctrine and complete adherence to it in practical life. Mere repetition of the word ‘food’ cannot dull hunger; mere chanting of a medical prescription cannot heal the disease. In the same way, if the Kalimah is repeated without an understanding, it cannot work the revolution which it is meant to bring about. This can occur only if a person grasps the full meaning of the doctrine and accepts and follows it in letter and spirit. We avoid fire because we know that it burns; we keep away from poison because we know that it can kill. Similarly, if the real meanings of Tawhid are fully grasped, we avoid, in belief as well as in action, every form of disbelief, atheism and polytheism.
-	In Arabic the word ilah means ‘one who is worshipped’, that is, a being which on account of its greatness and power is considered worthy to be worshipped: to be bowed to in humility and submission. Anything or any being possessing power too great to be comprehended by man is also called ilah. The concept ilah also includes the possession of infinite powers and conveys the sense that others are dependent on ilah and that he is not dependent on anyone else. The word ilah carries, too, a sense of concealment and mystery.
-	The word Allah, on the other hand, is the essential personal name of God. La ilaha illallah literally means “There is no ilah other than the One Great Being known by the name Allah.” It means that in the whole of the universe, there is absolutely no being worthy to be worshipped other than Allah.
-	Having a deity and worshipping him is ingrained in human nature. There is something within man’s soul which forces him to do so. But the question is: what is that thing and why does man feel impelled to do so? The answer to this question can be discovered if we look at the position of man in this huge universe. Neither man nor his nature is omnipotent. He is neither self-sufficient nor self-existing; nor are his powers limitless. In fact, he is weak, frail, needy and destitute.
-	He sees the sun, the moon and the stars in their constant motions. He reflects how great, powerful and grand these bodies are, and, in contrast to them, how frail and insignificant he himself is! He thinks of the hands which are wielding these great forces.
-	The sense of their powerfulness makes him seek their help. He tries to please them so that they may be beneficent to him, and he fears them and tries to escape their wrath so that he may not be destroyed by them. In the most primitive stage of ignorance, man thinks that the great objects injurious or beneficent to him, hold in themselves the real power and of nature whose grandeur and glory are visible, and which appear to be authority, and, therefore, are divine. Thus he worships trees, animals, rivers, mountains, fire, rain, air, heavenly bodies and numerous other objects. This is the worst form of ignorance.
-	he comes to know that these great and powerful objects are in themselves as helpless and dependent, or rather, they are still more dependent and helpless. The biggest and the strongest animal dies like a tiny germ, and loses all his power; great rivers rise and fall and become dry; the highest mountains are blasted and shattered by man himself; 
-	After these considerations man’s mind turns to the possibility of some great mysterious power of divine nature which controls the objects he sees and which may be the repository of all authority. These reflections give rise to belief in mysterious powers behind natural phenomena, with innumerable gods governing various parts and aspects of nature such as air, light and water. This, too, is a form of ignorance, and reality remains hidden to the human eye even at this stage of man’s intellectual and cultural pilgrimage. 
-	As man progresses still further in knowledge and learning, and as he reflects more and more deeply on the fundamental problems of existence, he finds an all-powerful law and all-encompassing control in the universe. What a complete regularity is observed in sunrise and sunset, in winds and rains, in the motions of stars and the changes of seasons.
-	even a polytheist finds himself obliged to believe that there must be a deity greater than all the others, exercising supreme authority. For, if there were separate, independent deities, the whole machinery of the universe would be upset. He calls this greatest deity by different names, such as Allah, Permeshwar, God, Khuda-iKhuda’igan. But as the darkness of ignorance still persists. he continues worshipping minor deities along with the Supreme One.
-	More enlightened men bring each one of them under the searchlight of scrutiny and ultimately find that none of these man-made deities has any divine character; they themselves are creatures like man, though rather more helpless. he implies that there must be one “supreme” authority in control, because had there been more than one, there would have been chaos and conflict. You cannot think of two governors for the same province or two supreme commanders of the army. They are thus eliminated one by one until only one God remains. 
-	But the concept of one God still contains some remnants of the elements of ignorance. Some people imagine that He has a body as men have and is in a particular place. Some believe that God came down to earth in human form; others think that God, after settling the affairs of the universe, retired and is now resting. Some believe that it is necessary to approach God through the media of saints and spirits, and that nothing can be achieved without their intercession.
-	Such distorted notions of godhead have persisted and lingered, and many of them are prevalent among different people even today. Tawhid is the highest conception of godhead; the knowledge of which God has sent mankind in all ages through His Prophets. It was this knowledge with which, in the beginning, Adam was sent down to earth; it was the same. knowledge that was revealed to Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus (God’s blessings be upon them all). It was this knowledge which Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) brought to mankind. Tawhid dispels all the clouds of ignorance and illuminates the horizon with the light of reality.
-	Tawheed can be divided into three categories. 
-	Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah (maintaining the unity of Lordship). Unique in action and lordship: Created the universe and everything in it, He alone creates, maintains and sustains, His actions are unique. * Quran: “Allah is the creator of all things and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs”.
-	Tawheed al-Asmaa-was-sifaat (maintaining the unity of Allah's name and attributes). : No one can possess the attributes of Allah to the same level of perfection. For instance, a man may be forgiving but cannot be as forgiving as Allah. Similarity of traits exists in name, but not in degree
-	Tawheed al-Ibaadah (maintaining the unity of worship): Allah has no offspring, no partners, not born from anyone. He alone deserves to be worshipped. *Quran: “Yet they have taken besides Him, gods that can create nothing but are themselves created”.
Impact of Tawhid Upon the Life of a Muslim/Individual: 
Read page 55 towards understanding islam
1) Inculcates self-respect and self-esteem: Since Allah is the only one who provides and maintains life, a person becomes fearless of other human beings. People bow in front of Allah only, and do not beg anyone else as only Allah can solve their problems. 
2) Freedom from slavery and dominion of other human beings and non-living deities: This leads to the moral and spiritual development of Muslims 
3) Modesty: Man realizes how powerless he is. He does not boast and is not arrogant, because Allah has given, and Allah can take back. 
4) Makes him dutiful, virtuous and upright: Knows that in order to succeed, he has to follow the path of Allah 
5) Allows him to make a distinction between good and bad/halal and haram 
6) Brave, strong and courageous: Only Allah can solve problems and remove hardships. No need to bow down or ask humans for help or depend on their assistance too much. 
7) Satisfaction and peace of mind and body: No more fear of death, prepared for afterlife 
8) Believers never become hopeless 
9) Become obedient and determined 
Impact of Tawhid Upon Society (Collective): 
1) Equality amongst humans: All created by one God, all son of Adam and Eve. All created from same material, eradicates all distinctions with respect to race, caste, sex, class etc. 
2) Unity and brotherhood: Tawhid instils the concept of all Muslims belonging to one ummah irrespective of geographical distance. All believers are one body and when one part gets hurt, the entire body suffers. 
3) Concept of human dignity: Allah created man as His vicegerent on earth, hence all men enjoy dignity and respect
Iman on Prophets
-	how to acquire knowledge of and belief in God, His Attributes, His Law and the Day of Judgement?
-	Some men have argued that there are two gods, others have professed belief in a trinity, and still others have succumbed to polytheism. Some have worshipped nature and others divided the Creator into the gods of rain, air, fire, life, death and so on. Similarly, men have put forward many erroneous notions about life after death; for instance, that man is reduced to dust after death and will not rise to life again.
-	Even greater difficulty arises when we come to the question of a code of living. To formulate a complete and balanced code that conforms to God’s pleasure merely using human reason is an extremely difficult task. Even if a man is equipped with the highest faculties of reason and intellect and possesses matchless wisdom and experience, the chances of his formulating the correct views on existence are slight.
-	Through His Grace and Benevolence He raised for mankind men from among themselves to whom He imparted the true knowledge of His attributes, revealed to them His Law and the Right Code of Living, gave them the knowledge of the meaning and purpose of life and of life after death and thus showed them the way by which man can achieve success and eternal bliss.
-	These chosen men are the Messengers of God - His Prophets. God has communicated knowledge and wisdom to them by means of revelation (Wahi), and the book containing the Divine Communications is called the Book of God, or the Word of God. The test of man’s wisdom and intellect therefore lies in this: does he recognise God’s Messengers after observing their pure and pious lives and carefully studying their noble and flawless teachings? A man of wisdom and common sense would accept instructions given by the Messengers of truth. If he denies the Messengers of God and their teachings, his denial would signify that he was devoid of the capacity to discover truth and righteousness. He would fail his test. Such a man will never be able to discover the truth about God and His Law and life after death.
-	man is blessed with all those powers, capacities and faculties - physical, mental and moral - which he requires in his struggle for life. But God has not distributed these gifts equally. This would have made men totally independent of each other and would have exclude mutual care and co-operation. Thus, although mankind as a whole possesses all that is needed, between men capacities are distributed unequally and sparingly. Some possess physical strength and prowess, others distinguish themselves for their mental talents.
-	These special aptitudes make a man distinct and enable him to grasp those intricacies which elude the common man. These insights, aptitudes and talents are the gifts of God. They are innate in the nature of those men whom God has destined to be thus distinguished. They cannot be acquired merely by education and training.
-	do people just need specialists in the fields of law and politics, science and mathematics, engineering and mechanics, finance and economics and the like? Or do they also need men to show them the right path - the way to God and salvation?
-	Our reason refuses to accept that God, Who has provided man with even the smallest of his requirements, would not provide for this greatest and most vital need. It can never be so. And it is not so. While God has produced men of distinction in arts and science, He has also raised men with deep vision, pure intuition and the highest faculties to know and understand Him. To them, He revealed the way of godliness, piety and righteousness. He gave them the knowledge of the aims of life and values of morality and entrusted them with the duty to communicate Divine Revelation to other human beings. These men are the Prophets and Messengers of God.
-	a Prophet’s mind grasps problems which defy other minds; he throws light on subjects which no one else can; he has insights into such subtle and intricate questions that no one else would have even understood after years of deep thought and meditation.
-	If, however, we ourselves try to produce the same or a similar work, we inevitably meet with failure. In all affairs his attitude is that of truthfulness, straightforwardness and nobility. He never does or utters wrong, nor does he commit any evil.
-	Neither his words nor his deeds are prompted by self-interest. He suffers for the good of others, and never makes others suffer for his own good. When it becomes quite clear that a person is a true Prophet of God, the natural dictate of this realisation is that his words should be accepted, his instructions followed and his orders obeyed. It is illogical to accept a man as God’s true Prophet and yet not to believe in what he says and not to follow what he ordains; Disobedience of him is disobedience of God - and disobedience of God leads to ruin.
-	You may not be able fully to grasp the wisdom and usefulness of this or that order, but the very fact that an instruction has emanated from a Prophet is sufficient guarantee of its truth. One’s inability to understand it does not mean there is something wrong with it. Rather it is our understanding which is at fault.
-	This Straight Path has been indicated by the Prophets, and there is and can be no straight path besides that. The man who ignores that path soon finds himself lost in the maze created by his own fancy. What can you think of a person who loses his way and, when a good man shows him the right one, defiantly declares: “I will not take your guidance nor accept the way you have shown to me, but I will myself grope in this unknown region and try to reach the object of my search in my own way?” This, in the presence of the clear guidance of the Prophets, is sheer stupidity. If everybody tried to start from scratch, it would be a gross waste of time and energy. We never do so in the sciences and arts: why here?
-	This refusal may be due to false arrogance, or blind conservatism and obstinate adherence to the way of one’s forefathers, or to slavery to the lower desires of the self, whose gratification becomes impossible by submission to the teachings of the Prophets.
-	Anyone who rejects the Prophets of God is a Kafir, be he a believer in God or a disbeliever.
-	Suppose ten men make one and the same statement; if you admit one of them to be true, you ipso facto admit the remaining nine as true, and if you belie any one of them, by implication you belie all of them. It is for this reason that in Islam it is necessary to have implicit faith in all the Prophets of God. One who does not believe in a particular Prophet would be a Kafir, though he may profess faith in all the other Prophets.
-	Tradition has it that the total number of Prophets sent to different peoples at different times is 124,000. We have to positively believe in those of the Prophets whose names have been mentioned in the Qur’an. Regarding the rest, we are instructed to believe that all the Prophets sent by God for the guidance of mankind were true.
-	Nor are we permitted to say anything against the holy men of other religions. It is quite possible that some of them might have been God’s Prophets, and their followers corrupted their teachings after their demise, just as the followers of Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them) have done. Therefore, whenever we express any opinion about them, it should be about the tenets and rituals of their religions; as for the founders of those religions, we will remain scrupulously silent, lest we should become guilty of irreverence towards a Prophet.
Finality of Prophethood
-	Adam, the first man on earth, was also the first Prophet of God. He revealed His religion - Islam - to him and told him to convey and communicate it to his descendants: to teach them that Allah is One. Those of Adam’s descendants who were good trod the right path, but those who were bad abandoned their father’s teachings. Some began to worship the sun, the moon and the stars; others took to the worship of trees, animals and rivers.
-	In this way ignorance gave rise to many forms of polytheism and idolatry, and scores of religions were formulated. This was the age when Adam’s progeny had spread over the globe, and formed different races and nations. Every nation had created a different religion for itself, each with rituals of its own.
-	Every kind of evil custom grew; many evils began to be considered right and many right things were either ignored or condemned as wrong.2 At this stage God began to raise Prophets among every people. Each one reminded his people of the lesson they had forgotten. They put an end to idol-worship and the practice of associating other deities with God (shirk), did away with all customs of ignorance, taught them the right way of living in accordance with God’s pleasure, and gave them laws to be followed and enforced in society. God’s true Prophets were raised in every land and among every people. They all possessed one and the same religion - the religion of Islam.
-	The fundamental teachings of all the religions were the same, i.e. belief in the unity of God, adherence to a life of piety, goodness and peace, and belief in life after death with its just mechanism of reward and punishment.
-	Man’s attitude towards God’s Prophets has been strange. He has ill-treated them and refused to accept their teachings. Some of the prophets were expelled from their lands; some were assassinated.
-	The false tendencies, born of centuries of deviation, ignorance and malpractice, now took another form. Though they accepted their Prophets during their lives and practiced their teachings, after their deaths they introduced their own distorted ideas into their religions. They adopted novel methods of worshipping God; some even took to the worship of their Prophets. They made the Prophets the incarnations of God or the sons of God; some associated their Prophets with God in His Divinity. In short, man’s varied attitudes in this respect were a travesty of his reason and a mockery of himself; he made idols of those very persons whose holy mission was to smash idols.
-	in the beginning separate prophets appeared among different nations or groups of people, and the teaching of each Prophet was meant specially and specifically for his people. The reason was that at that stage of history, nations were so cut off from each other geographically that opportunities for mutual intercourse were non-existent. In such circumstances it was very difficult to propagate a common World Faith with an accompanying common system of law. In addition, the ignorance of the early nations was so great that it had given different forms to their moral aberrations and distortions of Faith. It was, therefore, necessary that different Prophets be raised to preach the Truth to them and win them over to God; to gradually eradicate evils and aberrations; to root out ignorance and teach them the simple, pious and righteous life.
-	With the progress and spread of commerce, industry and the arts, intercourse was established between nations. It became possible under these circumstances that one and the same faith, envisaging a comprehensive and all-embracing way of life, meeting the moral, spiritual, social, cultural, political, economic and other needs of men and embodying both religious and secular elements could be sent by God to the whole ‘of mankind. More than two thousand years ago mankind had reached such a mental awareness that it seemed to be craving for a universal religion.
-	At such a crucial stage of human civilisation, when the mind of man was itself craving for a world religion, a Prophet was raised in Arabia for the whole world and for all nations. The religion he was given to propagate was again Islam - but now in the form of a complete and fully-fledged system, covering all aspects of the life of man. He was Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him)!
Belief in God’s angels
-	to have faith in the existence of God’s angels. This is the second article of Islamic faith and is very important, because it absolves the concept of Tawhid from all impurities and frees it from the danger of every conceivable shadow of shirk (polytheism). 
-	The polytheists have associated two kinds of creatures with God: (a) Those who have material existence and are perceptible to the human eye, such as the sun, moon, stars, fire, water, animals, great men. (b) Those who have no material existence and are not perceptible to the human eye: the unseen beings who are believed to be engaged in the administration of the universe; for instance, one controls the air, another imparts light, another brings rain, and so on and so forth.
-	Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has informed us that these imperceptible spiritual beings, whom people believe to be deities of gods or God’s children, are really His angels. They have no share in God’s divinity; they cannot deviate from His commands even by the slightest fraction of an inch. God employs them to administer His Kingdom, and they carry out His orders exactly and accurately. They have no authority to do anything of their own accord; they cannot present to God any scheme conceived by themselves, they are not even authorised to intercede with God for any man. 
-	To worship them and to solicit their help is degrading and debasing for man. For, on the very first day of man’s creation, God had made them prostrate themselves before Adam, granted to him greater knowledge than they possessed and bestowed Adam His own vicegerency on this earth in preference to them.3 What debasement can, therefore, be greater for man than prostrating himself before those who had prostrated themselves before him! 
-	Muhammad (blessing of Allah and peace be upon him) forbade us to worship angels, and to associate them with God in His divinity. He also informed us that they were the chosen creatures of God, free from sin, from their very nature unable to disobey God, and ever engaged in carrying out His orders. 
-	They observe and note all our actions, good or bad. They preserve a complete record of every man’s life. After death, when we shall be brought before God, they will present a full report of our life’s-work on earth, wherein we shall find everything correctly recorded, not a single movement left out, however insignificant and however carefully concealed it may be. We have not been informed of the intrinsic nature of the angels. Only some of their virtues or attributes have been mentioned to us, and we have been asked to believe in their existence.
-	It would therefore, be sheer folly on our part to attribute any form or quality to them of our own accord. We must believe in them exactly as we have been asked to do. To deny their existence is kufr for, first, we have no reason for such a denial, and, second, our denial of them would be tantamount to attributing untruth to Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him). We believe in their existence only because God’s true Messenger has informed us of it.
Faith in the Books of God
-	The third article of faith which Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has commanded us to believe is faith in the Books of God, Books which He has sent down to mankind through His Prophets.
-	God had revealed His Books to His Prophets before Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) and these books were sent down in the same way as He sent down the Qur’an to Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him). We have been informed of the names of some of these books: Books of Abraham, the Torah of Moses, Zabur (Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus Christ. We have not been informed of the names of Books which were given to other Prophets. Therefore with regard to other existing religious books, we are not in a position to say with certainty whether they were originally revealed books or not. But we tacitly believe that whatever Books were sent down by God are all true. Of the Books we have been told, the Books of Abraham are extinct and not traceable in existing world literature. David’s Zabur, the Torah and the Inji’l exist with the Jews and the Christians, but the Qur’an informs us that people have changed and added to these books, and God’s words have been mixed up with texts of their own making.
-	The Qur’an is the last of the Divine Books sent down by God and there are some very pertinent differences between it and the previous Books. These differences may briefly be stated as follows:
-	The original texts of most of the former Divine Books were lost altogether, and only their translations exist today. The Qur’an, on the other hand, exists exactly as it was revealed to the Prophet.
-	Even a cursory study of the first books of the Old Testament and the four Gospels of the New Testament reveals that they are the productions of men and in these writings some parts of the original Psalms of David and the Gospels of Christ have been incorporated. The first five books of the Old Testament do not constitute the original Torah, but parts of the Torah have been mixed up with other narrative written by human beings and the original guidance of the Lord is lost. Similarly. the four Gospels of Christ are not the original Gospels as they came from the Prophet Christ (peace be upon him). They are in fact, the life-histories of Christ compiled by four different persons on the basis of knowledge and hearsay, and certain parts of the original Gospel also fell into them.

They are in fact, the life-histories of Christ compiled by four different persons on the basis of knowledge and hearsay, and certain parts of the original Gospel also fell into them.
-	Each one of the existing sacred Books found among different nations of the world has been addressed to a particular people. Each one contains a number of commands which seem to have been meant for a particular period of history and which meet the needs of that age only. They are neither needed today, nor can they now be smoothly and properly put into practice. It is evident from this that these Books were particularly meant for that particular people and not for the world. Furthermore, they were not sent to be followed permanently by even the people they were intended for; they were meant to be acted upon only for a certain period. In contrast to this the Qur’an is addressed to all mankind; not a single injunction of it can be suspected as having been addressed to a par- ticular people. In the same manner, all the commands and injunctions in the Qur’an can be acted upon at any place and in any age. This proves that the Qur’an is meant for the whole world, and is an eternal code for human life.
-	Faith in the earlier divine Books should be limited to the confirmation that they were all from God, were true and were sent down to fulfil, in their time, the same purpose for which the Qur’an has been sent. On the other hand, belief in the Qur’an should be of the nature that it is purely and absolutely God’s own words, that it is perfectly true, that every, word of it is preserved, that everything mentioned therein is right, that it is the bounden duty of man to carry out in his life each and every command of it and that whatever be against it must be rejected.
Belief in life after death
-	The fifth article of Islamic Faith is belief in life after death. The Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has directed us to believe in resurrection after death and in the Day of Judgement. The essential ingredients of this belief, as taught to us by him, are as follows: That the life of this world and of all that is in it will come to an end on an appointed day. Everything will be annihilated. That day is called Qiyamah, i.e. the Last Day. That all the human beings who have lived in the world since its inception will then be restored to life and will be presented before God Who will sit in judgement on that day. This is called Hashr (Resurrection). That the entire record of every man and woman - of all their doings and misdoings - will be presented before God for final judgement. That one who excels in goodness will be rewarded; one whose evils and wrongs outweigh his good deeds will be punished. That those who emerge successful in this judgement will go to Paradise and the doors of eternal bliss will be opened to them- those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to Hell - the abode of fire and torture.
-	The Need of this belief: In your everyday life, whenever you are asked to do anything, you immediately think: what is the use of doing it and what harm is involved in not doing it? This is in the very nature of man. He instinctively regards a useless action as totally unnecessary. You will never be willing to waste your time and energy in useless and unproductive jobs. Similarly, you will not be very eager to avoid a thing that is harmless. And the general rule is that the deeper your conviction about the utility of a thing, the firmer will be your response to it; and the more doubtful you are about its efficacy, the more wavering will be your attitude. After all, why does a child put his hand into fire? Because he is not sure that fire burns. Why does he evade study? Because he does not fully grasp the importance and benefits of education and does not believe in what his elders try to impress on his mind. Now think of the man who does not believe in the Day of Judgement. Will he not consider belief in God and a life in accordance with His code of no consequence? What value will he attach to a life in pursuit of His pleasure? To him neither obedience to God is of any advantage, nor disobedience to Him of any harm, How, then, can it be possible for him to scrupulously follow the injunctions of God, His Prophet, and His Book? What incentive will there be for him to undergo trials and sacrifices and to avoid worldly pleasures? And if a man does not follow the code of God and lives according to his own likes and dislikes, of what use is his belief in the existence of God, if indeed he has any such belief? That is not all. If you reflect still deeper, you will come to the conclusion that belief in life after death is the most decisive factor in the life of a man. Its acceptance or rejection determines the very course of his life and behaviour.
-	A Rational vindication: page 70 towards understanding islam
The above are the five articles of faith which form the foundation for the superstructure of Islam. Their gist is contained in the short sentence known as Kalimah-tayyibah. When you declare La- ilaha illallah (there is no deity but Allah), you give up all false deities, and profess that you are a creature of the One God; and when you add to these words Muhammad-urRasulullah (Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger) you confirm and admit the Prophethood of Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him). With the admission of his Prophethood it becomes obligatory that you should believe in the divine nature and attributes of God, in His angels, in His Revealed Books and in life after death, and earnestly follow that method of obeying God and worshipping Him which the Prophet Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) has asked us to follow. That way lies the road to success and salvation.
Taqdeer/Faith in the Unknown
-	It is an everyday experience that when you do not know a thing, you look for somebody who does know. When you want to go to some place and do not know the way, you ask somebody who knows it, and follow the way he points out. In educational matters you trust in your teacher. In short, the course that you adopt in your day-to-day life about matters which you do not or cannot know is that you approach someone who does know about them, accept his advice and act accordingly. You make every effort to select the proper person. But from then on you accept his advice unquestioningly. This kind of belief is called “belief in the unknown” (Iman -bi’l-ghayb).
-	Iman-bi'l-ghayb signifies that you get knowledge of what was not known to you from one who knows. You do not know God and His real attributes. You are not aware that His angels are directing the machinery of the whole Universe according to His orders, and that they surround you on all sides. You have not the proper knowledge of the way of life through which you can seek the pleasure of your Creator. And you are in the dark about the life to come. Such knowledge is given to you by the Prophets, who have had direct contact with the Divine Being. They are the persons whose sincerity, integrity, trustworthiness, godliness and absolute purity stand as irrevocable witnesses to the truth of their claim to knowledge. And above all, the wisdom and force of their message makes you admit that they speak the truth and deserve to be believed and followed. This conviction of yours is lman-bi’l-ghayb.

Islamic worships
Ref: Page 74 towards understanding islam
-	Believing in articles you enter the fold of Islam; can’t become muslim by mere vocal profession alone; carry out instructions given by Prophet ordained by God. What are those?
-	Ibadah; are the first and foremost things in this respect; Arabic word derived from ‘abd’ meaning slave; meaning submission; whatever slave does in obedience and pleasure for master is Ibadah; very wide concept; if you follow law of God in your speech, in your activities financial, social, dealings with parents, friends; heliping poor; all activities in accordance with law of God and your ultimate motive is to please Him is ibadah
-	To help achieve this aim a set of formal ‘Ibadah (worships) has been drawn up as a course of training. The ‘Ibadah are thus the pillars on which the edifice of Islam rests.
Salah
-	Most fundamental most imp; prescribed daily prayers;
-	Impacts: frequency and timing of the prayers never let you lose sight of the object and mission of life in the maze of worldly activities. strengthen the foundations of your faith, prepare you for the observance of a life of virtue and obedience to God, and refresh that belief from which springs courage, sincerity, purposefulness, purity of heart, advancement of the soul and enrichment of morals. Prayers are also a symbol of equality, for the poor and the rich, the low and the high, the rulers and the ruled, the educated and the unlettered, the black and the white, all stand in a row and prostrate themselves before their Lord. Prayers also inculcate a strong sense of discipline and obedience to an elected leader.
-	Now see how this is achieved. In prayers you recite many things quietly and if you do not recite them or make any deviation from them there is no-one to check you. But you never do so intentionally. Why? Because you believe that God is ever watchful, is listening to all that you recite and is aware of things both open and hidden.
-	Can there be a better course of moral and spiritual training than prayers? It is this training which makes a man a perfect Muslim. It reminds him of his covenant with God, refreshes his faith in Him and keeps the belief in the Day of Judgement alive and ever-present before his mind’s eye.
-	Shirking the prayers can only mean one of two things. Either we do not recognise prayers as our duty or we recognise them as our duty and still shirk them. In the first case, our claim to faith is a shameless lie, for if we refuse to take orders, we no longer acknowledge God’s Authority. In the second case, if we recognise His Authority and still flout His Commands, we are the most unreliable of the creatures that ever trod the earth. For if we can do this to the highest authority in the universe, what guarantee is there that we shall not do the same in our dealings with fellow human beings?
Fasting/Zakat/Hajj
-	NOTES
Sirah 
-	Arab in Jahiliya:  Things which are classed as ‘myth’ and ‘superstition’ today were the unquestionable truths of that age. Acts which we now regard as barbarous were then the order of the day. Methods which appear obnoxious to our moral sense today constituted the very soul of morality; The neighbouring countries of Persia, Byzantium and Egypt possessed a glimmer of civilisation and a faint light of learning. But Arabia stood isolated, cut off by vast tracts of desert.
-	they did not have a single educational institution or library. No one seemed interested in the cultivation and advancement of knowledge. The few who were literate were not educated enough to understand the existing arts and sciences.
-	a study of the remnants of their literature reveals how limited was their knowledge, how low was their standard of culture and civilisation, how saturated were their minds with superstitions, how barbarous and ferocious were their thoughts and customs, and how decadent were their moral standards. It was a country without a government. Each tribe considered itself to be an independent sovereign unit. There was no law except the law of the strongest. Loot, arson and murder of innocent and weak people was the order of the day. Life, property and honour were constantly in jeopardy. Tribes were always at daggers drawn with one another. Any trivial incident was enough to spark off a ferocious war. Indeed, Bedouins from one tribe thought they had every right to kill people from other tribes.
-	They revelled in adultery, gambling and drinking. Looting and murder were part of their everyday existence. They would stand stark naked before each other without any qualms of conscience. Even their women-folk would strip nude at the ceremony of circumambulating the Ka’bah. They would bury their daughters alive lest anyone should become their son-in-law. They would marry their step-mothers after the death of their fathers.
-	They worshipped stones, trees, idols, stars and spirits; in short, everything conceivable except God. They knew nothing about the teachings of the Prophets of old. They had an idea that Abraham and Ishmael were their forefathers, but they knew next to nothing about their religious preachings and about the God Whom they worshipped. The stories of Ad and Thamud were to be found in their folklore, but they contained no traces of the teachings of the Prophets Hud and Salih. The Jews and Christians had passed on to them certain legends relating to the Israelite Prophets. They presented a harrowing picture of those noble souls.
-	A deputation of the leading Quraish called upon the Holy Prophet and tried to bribe him by offering him the worldly glory they could imagine. They said: “If you want to possess wealth, we will amass for you as much as you wish; if you aspire to win honour and power we are prepared to swear allegiance to you as our overlord and king; if you have a fancy for beauty. you shall have the hand of the most beautiful maiden of your choice.” But they wanted him to abandon his mission. The terms were extremely tempting for any human mortal. But they had no significance for the Great Prophet.
-	In the court of King Negus, Jaffar made a speech which threw light on the revolution that the Holy Prophet had brought about. He said: “O King! We were ignorant people, given to idolatry. We were used to eating corpses even of dead animals, and to doing all kinds of disgraceful things. We did not carry out our obligations to our relations, and ill-treated our neighbours. The strong among us would thrive at the expense of the weak, till, at last, God raised a Prophet for our reformation… He forbade all manner of indecent things: telling lies, misappropriating orphan’s belongings, and bringing false accusation against the chastity of women. So we believed in him. followed him, and acted upon his teaching..”

Rise of Extremism
-	Islamophobia notes by hamza
-	Extremism in Pak and its solution in light of Quran and sunnah
-	Fundamentalism first emerged in Christianity, as a reaction to the liberal interpretation of the religion by Protestantism, at renaissance period in Europe. In 20th century the world saw the resurgence of Islamic world as a reaction to the colonial liberal ideologies of the west. The term “extremism” was coined for those who were religious and desired to take religion on the cost of modernity. A tug of war started between liberal extremists and religious extremists, which resulted in imposing forcefully, ones ideology on his counterpart. From the lap of this mutual struggle came out “terrorism” the most notorious term of the century, destroying most countries of the Muslim world.
-	Fundamentalism
-	According to Karan Armstrong, “In Arabic, literally the term refers to the study of the sources of Islamic law and its various principles”. However in west there are some, who have only a fundamentalist façade, but there objectives are not, what, they appear to be.6 Therefore the term is obscured and misleading.
-	The past few decades have witnessed a great upsurge of Islam on the political scene, which can be seen nearly everywhere in the Islamic world, including in the Iranian Revolution of 1979; the rise of Islamic activism in Lebanon and Islam in the Contemporary World among the Palestinians; the strengthening of revivalist movements in Egypt and Algeria; the increase of power of Islamic parties in Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia; Taliban in Afghanistan; and the ever increasing strength of Islamic forces even in the outwardly secular state that is Turkey7 . Due to a great misunderstanding of these movements in the West, they have usually been grouped together under the name of “fundamentalism,” a word originally taken from an American Protestant context and then applied to Islam and other religions.
-	There exists in the Islamic world the widely prevalent desire, shared by the great majority of Muslims, to preserve their religious and cultural identity, to reapply the Divine Law that was replaced by European legal codes during the colonial period in many Islamic lands, to draw the various parts of the Islamic world and the Islamic people (alummah) closer together, and to reassert the intellectual, cultural, and artistic traditions of Islam. These widely held wishes and the impulse to implement them must not be identified purely and simply as “fundamentalism.” Rather, most people who share these ideals are traditional Muslims.
-	Then there is an older puritanical and often rationalistic reform movement, or rather set of movements, that seeks to return to a strict application of the Sharī‘ah while opposing both Western encroachment and the intellectual, artistic, and mystical traditions of Islam itself in the name of an early puritan Islam considered to have been lost by later generations. To this category belongs the Wahhābī movement, which, in alliance with the Saudi family, finally captured Arabia during the early twentieth century and which remains dominant in that land today. Such movements as the Salafiyyah of Syria and Egypt and the Muhammadiyyah of Indo-nesia are related to some extent in their perspectives to Wahhābism and need to be mentioned here although they also differ from Wahhābism in basic ways. One can also include in the category of “fundamentalism” the Ikhwān al-muslimīn, founded in Egypt in the 1920s by Hasan al-Bannā’, a movement that is still strong in many Islamic countries, especially Egypt and the Sudan, and the Jamā‘at-I islāmī of Pakistan, founded by Mawlānā Mawdūdī after the partition of the Indian Subcontinent9 . The latter continues to be a strong religio-political force to be reckoned with in Pakistan as well as through its offshoots in Bangladesh and among the Muslims of India. All of these movements share in their desire to re-Islamize society and to apply the Sharī‘ah fully and have usually been peaceful in their methods of achieving this, except in the case of Wahhābism, especially during its earlier history, when it came to power as a result of its political union with the Saudi family in the Najd.
-	In the whole world nations are struggling to reform their religion, customs and traditions because those were framed for totally different social setup at that time, and are completely alien to the existing ones. Fundamentalists think that they are in a state of war with the forces which are trying to destroy their sacred values.10 The thing which is difficult for both the counterparts is to understand each other point of view. For resolving issues, it is vital to understand each other. If they became able to listen to and understand each other there will be no hatred, violence and clashes in the name of ideologies or civilizations.
-	Extremism
-	In liberal democracies, extremism is applied to any ideology that advocates radical or religious supremacy or opposes the core principle of democracy and human rights. Within Islam, notion of extremism is ascribed to the thoughts of the ‘chosen ones’ and the ‘perfect people’, which is construed as a diseased thought that lends bias, prejudice and a sense of narcissism and these feeling always leads to violence.12 Therefore if people belonging to any religion, sect or ideological orientation claims to be absolutely right, and impose their ideas and values on other religion, sect or people of other ideological orientation, with force and use means of violence, against an unyielding counterpart, are extremists. Hiding of body and veil (Nikaab) of Muslim females considered as religious extremism by the liberal west. Though it is something very personal and has nothing to do with lives and actions of others. The taking up of the veils is similar act and may be termed as secular extremism.
-	It is note worthy is the fact that in a society where millions are barely literate, raised to revere rather than to question, and with limited sources of information, should not be surprising to being easily swept up in mob hysteria anyone accused of insulting their religion. When we use Islam for the accomplishment of our own objectives, reduces its vigor, similarly a state, a government or a group interpret it in a manner which fulfill their objectives, in both the cases the kind of Islam, is not Islam, but in this shape, it determine a direction of clash between “we” and “them”, benefits none of them. It is a fact that for the last few centuries, Muslims in all corners of the world have been subjected to violence by liberal forces and their allies. The colonialist European states with the alliance of the local oppressive regimes have caused great sufferings to the Muslims at large. However for Muslims, this was a situation that has to be approached and responded to form a purely Quranic stance. In no part of the Quran dose God command believer to respond to violence. On the contrary the God commands Muslims to “respond to evil with goodness”13 . 
-	A good deed and a bad deed is not the same. Repel the bad with something better and, if there is enmity between you and someone else, he will be like a bosom friend.14 (Quran, 41:34). carrying out terrorist acts against the innocent people “representing innocent group” is by no means compatible with Islam.
-	It it is not Christianity verses Islam but rather it is the anti-religious, liberal and materialistic west which is conflicting Islam. Contrary to the general opinion, it is between the religious people of the west and of the Muslim world on one hand, and the people opposing religion (materialists, atheists, Darwinists etc) on the other hand.
-	According to Samuel P Huntington, there are two world cultures that are bound to clash, one is democratic and essentially secular in approach toward governance that west has developed over a couple of centuries. The other was Islam & Chinese in which the individual counted much less than the community of which he or she was a part. 
-	Causes
-	There is no doubt that the west has to share blame in a big way for creating a Frankenstein by destabilizing the middle east, especially Iraq, Syria and Libya, without providing any alternative. The prospects for the ordinary people of these countries extremely bleak, unbearable living conditions at home due to a raging civil war; furthermore restriction on the flow of refugees would be negative fallout from this event. Extremist right political parties and conservative groups in Europe will exploit this incident by stoking anti-Muslim sentiments, which will further increase the sense of deprivation in already deprived Muslims, and will fan extremism.
-	The ‘act of war’ talk may be good rhetoric it is bad policy. Besides by invoking the language of war to describe a terror attack, President Bush made the mistake of elevating a group like AI-Qaeda to a sovereign entity, suggests Noah Felman that, “this was a mistake with respect to Al-Qaeda, but it is a greater mistake when it comes to the Islamic state, whose primary aspiration is to achieve statehood, by saying that the Islamic state is in a war with France, Holland is unwittingly giving the ragtag group the international stature it seeks
-	Illiteracy; sectarianism 
Imp of Revelation
One of the singular distinctions of Islam is the balance maintained between ‘aql and naql, that is, between human rational thought and revealed scripture. Certain people admit the intellect alone to be the source of knowledge, whether in the realm of the manifest or the hidden. Others hold transmitted or revealed knowledge alone to be the font of all truths. Others yet take a position between these two, granting each of them an authoritative status.
Reason (aql)
The dictionary al-Mu’jam al-wasit, published by the Arabic Language Academy in Cairo, defines reason as what responds to the natural instincts; what enables thought and reasoning and composition and illustration and attestation; and what distinguishes the beautiful from the repulsive, good from evil, and truth from falsehood. The term is derived from the root ‘ayn qaf lam, its essential meaning being prevention. It so named because reason prevents its bearer from what does not correspond to it, unlike beasts, which act according to their appetites.
Or we might say, through reason humans ponder the origins and ends of existence, and our existence with it, and the prophecies we have received. In other words, reason searches out satisfactory answers to the enduring questions that humans have asked since time immemorial, namely: who am I? And where am I going? And why?
Revelation (naql)
This term can fruitfully be compared to reason. It is the knowledge that emerges from Divine revelation or a Prophetic source. This knowledge is inherited through the generations, being transmitted by one to another; it cannot be attained through empirical observation or experience or theoretical reasoning or deduction. It is passed from one to another, through solid chains of transmission, even unto its Divine revelation to the Prophet. Those who transmitted it affirmed its holy origin and embraced its incontrovertible foundations, even while they had the right to use their rational faculties in understanding, commenting upon, and explaining its derivation. There is no doubt that the greatest minds of the Umma worked in its service and sanctification, due to whose efforts we now have the various disciplines of exegesis, hadith, fiqh, sufism, theology, and theoretical sciences necessary for these such as legal theory, the principles of commentary, and hadith methodology.
Relation btw both
The scholars of Kalam (also known as usul al-din) held that the intellect is the basis of revelation, in the sense that revealed scripture is affirmed through rational means. For it is the intellect that indicates the possibility of divine revelation and establishes its wisdom and its having actually occurred. It further provided evidence to validate the prophethood of Muhammad, God bless him and grant him peace, and to verify his message. Had we doubted its veracity through our reason, the traditional arguments too would have broken down. Yet after having propounded these decisive proofs for the prophethood of Muhammad, God bless him and grant him peace, that he is truly the messenger of God and that the scripture he came with is truly of divine provenance, the intellect is left little to do except receive that message, preserve it, and convey it to others. Al-Ghazali noted something similar for its fate after receiving the Divine notices regarding the realities of existence and the realm of the unseen, just as it did the Divine rulings (injunctions and proscriptions): It does not become a believing man or woman, when God and his messenger have decided a matter, that they should [then] claim any say in their affair (Q 33:36).
Some might say: if Islam is a divine system set forth for people by their Lord, does this not mean that the role of human agency and reason is extinguished in the face of that system? And that its efforts are absolutely negated, for all that is asked is accepting the message, implementing it, and submitting to it—all without asking why or how? There is then no parity between reason and revelation—if the revelation is understood as Divine speech, what then is left reason but to comply and submit?
Divine decree does not extinguish the role of human will or agency in the universe, even with the hand of God therein and the lack of parity between Divine and human will or between the powers of the creator and the created. In similar fashion, Divine revelation does not extinguish the role of human reason and its scriptural imperative, its purposes of derivation and deduction that fill out the matters on which scripture is silent. The presence of a holy text does not obstruct the flight and creativity of reason, for it leaves the latter various realms in which to exercise and establish itself.
Sharia 
Shari’ah, the detailed code of conduct or the canons comprising ways and modes of worship, standards of morals and life and laws that allow and proscribe, that judge between right and wrong. Such canon law has undergone amendments from time to time and though each Prophet had the same Din, he brought with him a different Shari’ah to suit the conditions of his own people and time. This process ended with the advent of Muhammad, the last Prophet (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him), who brought with him the final code which was to apply to all mankind for all times to come. Din has undergone no change, but all the previous Shari’ahs stand abrogated because of the comprehensive Shari’ah that Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) brought with him. This is the climax of the great process of training that was started at the dawn of the human era.
The primary sources of Islamic law are the Holy Book (The Quran), The Sunnah (the traditions or known practices of the Prophet Muhammad ), Ijma' (Consensus), and Qiyas (Analogy).
Need for sharia?
when we look at human beings, we find that there are two kinds of people: first, those who knowingly misuse their powers and resources and through this misuse waste the resources, injure their own vital interests, and cause harm to other people; and, second, those who are sincere and earnest but err because of ignorance. Those who intentionally misuse their powers are wicked and evil and deserve to feel the full weight of the law. Those who err because of ignorance, need proper knowledge and guidance so that they see the Right Path and make the best use of their powers and resources. And the code of behaviour - the Shari’ah - which God has revealed to man meets this very need. The Shari’ah stipulates the law of God and provides guidance for the regulation of life in the best interests of man. Its objective is to show the best way to man and provide him with the ways and means to fulfil his needs in the most successful and most beneficial way. The law of God is out and out for your benefit.
It does not say: abandon the world, give up all ease and comfort of life, leave your homes and wander about on plains and mountains and in jungles without bread or cloth, putting yourself to inconvenience and self-annihilation. This viewpoint has no relevance to the law of Islam, a law that has been formulated by God Who has created this world for the benefit of mankind.
The Shari’ah is meant to guide the steps of man in this respect. It forbids all that is harmful to man, and allows or ordains all that is useful and beneficial to him. The fundamental principle of the Law is that man has the right, and in some cases the bounden duty, to fulfil all his genuine needs and desires and make every conceivable effort to promote his interests and achieve success and happiness - but (and it is an important ‘but’) he should do all this in such a way that not only are the interests of other people not jeopardised and no harm is caused to their strivings towards the fulfilment of their rights and duties, but there should be all possible social cohesion, mutual assistance and co-operation among human beings in the achievement of their objectives.
The sources of human knowledge are too limited to provide him with the unalloyed truth. That is why God has spared man the risks of trial and error and revealed to him the Law which is the right and complete code of life for the entire human race.
Even today some people do not appreciate all the merits of this code, but further progress of knowledge will throw new light on them and bring their superiority into even clearer perspective. The world is willy-nilly drifting towards the Divine Code - many of those people who refused to accept it are now, after centuries of groping and trials and errors, being obliged to adopt some of the provisions of this law. Those who denied the truth of the revelation and pinned their faith on unguided human reason, after committing blunders and courting bitter experience, are adopting in one way or another the injunctions of Shari’ah.

Sources
Quran
We draw upon two major sources to learn about the Shari’ah of Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him), the Qur’an and the Hadith. The Qur’an is a divine revelation - each and every word of it is from Allah. The Hadith is a collection of the instructions issued or the memoirs of the last Prophet’s conduct and behaviour, as preserved by those who were present in his company or those to whom these were handed down by the first witnesses. These were later sifted and collected by divines and compiled in the form of books among which the collections made by Malik, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah are considered to be the most authentic.
Surah nisa; 
Sunnah
Literally, Sunnah means a clear path or a beaten track but it has also been used to imply normative practice, or an established course of conduct. It may be a good example or a bad, and it may be set by an individual, a sect or a community.
The Sunnah, according to the scholars of hadeeths, is everything that has been related from the Messenger (SAW), of his statements, actions, tacit approvals, personality, physical description, or biography.  It does not matter whether the information being related refers to something before the beginning of his prophetic mission, or after it. The statements of the Prophet include everything the Prophet said for various reasons on different occasions. The actions of the Prophet include everything that the Prophet did that was related to us by his Companions.  This includes how he made ablutions, how he performed his prayers, and how he made the Hajj pilgrimage.
The tacit approval of the Prophet includes everything that his Companions said or did that he either showed his favour towards or at least did not object to.  Anything that had the tacit approval of the Prophet is as valid as anything that he said or did himself.
Relation of Quran and Sunnah
An adequate answer to the question as to whether the Sunnah is a mere supplement to the Qur’an or a source in its own right necessitates an elaboration of the relationship of the Sunnah to the Qur’an is tried in the following paragraphs:
The Holy Quran is the foundation of Islamic Law.  It is the miraculous speech of Allah that was revealed to the Messenger, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, by way of the angel Gabriel.  It has been transmitted to us with so many chains of authority that its historical authenticity is unquestionable.  It is written down in its own volume, and its recitation is a form of worship.
As for the Sunnah, it is everything besides the Holy Quran that came from Allah’s Messenger.  It explains and provides details for the laws found in the Holy Quran.  It also provides examples of the practical application of these laws.  It is also either direct revelation from Allah, or decisions of the Messenger that were then confirmed by revelation.  Therefore, the source of all the Sunnah is revelation.
The Holy Quran takes precedence over the Sunnah in two ways.  For one thing, the Holy Quran consists of the exact words of Allah, miraculous in nature, down to the last verse.  The Sunnah, however, is not necessarily the exact words of Allah, but rather their meanings as explained by the Holy Prophet (SAW).
AL-mudailha reference
The Holy Quran provides the general injunctions that formed the basis of the Law, without going into all the details and secondary legislation, with the exception of a few injunctions that are established along with the general principles.  These injunctions are not subject to change over time or with the changing circumstances of the people.  The Holy Quran, likewise, comes with the tenets of belief, sets down acts of worship, mentions the stories of the nations of old, and provides moral guidelines.
The Sunnah comes in agreement with the Holy Quran.  It explains the meanings of what is unclear in the text, provides details for what is depicted in general terms, specifies what is general, and explains its injunctions and objectives.  The Sunnah also comes with injunctions that are not provided by the Holy Quran, but these are always in harmony with its principles, and they always advance the objectives that are outlined in the Holy Quran.
The Sunnah is a practical expression of what is in the Holy Quran.  This expression takes many forms.  Sometimes, it comes as an action performed by the Messenger.  At other times, it is a statement that he made in response to something.  Sometimes, it takes the form of a statement or action of one of the Companions that he neither prevented nor objected to.  On the contrary, he remained silent about it or expressed his approval for it.

The Sunnah explains and clarifies the Holy Quran in many ways.  It explains how to perform the acts of worship and carry out the laws that are mentioned in the Holy Quran.  Allah commands the believers to pray without mentioning the times that the prayers had to be performed or the manner of performing them.  The Messenger clarified this through his own prayers and by teaching the Muslims how to pray.  He said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”
An example of where the Sunnah provides subsidiary legislation for an injunction found in the Holy Quran is the ruling found in the Sunnah that it is forbidden to sell fruit before it begins to ripen.  The basis for this law is the statement of the Holy Quran:
Do not consume your property amongst you unjustly, except it is a trade among you by mutual consent.
The Sunnah contains rulings that are not mentioned in the Holy Quran and that do not come as clarifications for something mentioned in the Holy Quran.  An example of this is the prohibition of eating donkey flesh and the flesh of predatory beasts.  Another example of this is the prohibition of marrying a woman and her aunt at the same time.  These and other rulings provided by the Sunnah must be adhered to.
The obligation of adhering to the Sunnah?
A requirement of believing in Prophet-hood is to accept as true everything that Allah’s Messenger (SAW) said.  Allah chose His Messengers (SAW) from among His worshippers to convey His Law to humanity.  Allah says:
“â€¦Allah knows best with whom to place His Messageâ€¦” Al-An’am
Allah also says:
“â€¦Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey the clear Message?”An-Nahl
“And obey Allah and the Messenger, that ye may find mercy.” Aal- Imran
The Messenger is protected from error in all of his actions.  Allah has protected his tongue from uttering anything but the truth.  Allah has protected his limbs from doing anything but what is right.
Allah has safeguarded him from showing approval for anything contrary to Islamic Law.
“By the star when it sets.  Your companion has neither gone astray nor has he erred.  Nor does he speak of his own desire.  It is only revelation that has been revealed.” (Holy Quran 53:1-4)
“Those who annoy Allah and His Messenger – Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.” Al-Ahzab
“And whatsoever the Messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it).” Al- Hashr
History and imp of Ahadees
Word “Hadis” is derived from Arabic word “Hadasa”, which means, “to be new” (opposite of ancient)
According to Seyyed Nasr, the hadith contains the words of Muhammad, while the sunnah contains his words and actions along with pre-Islamic practices of which he approved.
Types of Hadis
Hadis-i-Nabvi: A Hadis that contains words which the Holy Prophet (PBUH) himself spoke is called Hadis Nabvi. 
Hadis-i-Qudsi: A Hadis that contains words from Allah is termed as Hadis-i-Qudsi. For example, one Hadis reads: “Allah says: Fasting is for Me and I shall certainly compensate it”. The afore-said words do not figure in the Holy Quran but as these are the words of Allah which have been spoken by the Holy Prophet (PBUH), such a Hadis is known as Hadis-i-Qudsi. 
Sahih Hadis: If a Hadis fulfils the criterion laid down to ascertain both its sanad (veracity of the chain of narrators) and Matn (the text, or what the Holy Prophet (PBUH) actually said or did), it is called an Authentic or Sahih Hadis. 
Hassan Hadis: If the Matn is authentic and, in the overall context too, the Hadis is deemed to be genuine, it is accepted as such and termed as Hassan Hadis even if at some steps its narrators have been found to be somewhat defective in memory in comparison with those who narrated Sahih Hadis. 
Zaeef Hadis: If anyone of the narrators was known to be a liar, have had a bad memory or had not met the person whom he was supposed to be narrating from, the Hadis quoted by him is classified as un-authentic, in-accurate or Zaeef. 
Fabricated Hadis: The sayings and doings wrongly attributed to the Holy Prophet (PBUH) which actually were not said or done by him were called Fabricated Hadis. 
Musnad Hadis: In this category, Hadis traced back to each companion of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) was put together under his name, no matter what their theme or contents were. Therefore, the titles of the chapter in this category are Masnad of Abu Bakr, Musnad of Abu Hurairah, Musnad of Aisha, Musnad of Imam Ahmad bin Hambal. A Musnad is relevant in a situation only if the requirement is to know the views or propouncements of a specific person but it is of no consequence if ready answers are warranted for specific questions. 
Musannaf Hadis: In this category, the collection of Hadis is grouped into chapters and subchapters according to their theme for example, chapters on prayer, Fasting, Zakat, Hajj, Purity, Marriage etc. Al-Muwatta of Imam Malik, Sahih of Bukhari and Muslim, the Sunan works of AlNasai, Abu Daud and Ibn Majah all fall in this category.
Rules adopted to check authenticity of the chain of narrators. 
(1)	The narrators were pious, noble, honest, well-reputed persons who had good memory and had written down what they had heard. 
(2)	A narrator actually met the other narrator and in this way the chain of narration went right back to the Holy Prophet (PBUH). 
(3)	The narrator was physically, mentally and intellectually fit to understand the full importance and impact of all what he had heard. 
(4)	The last person in the chain of narration was a companion of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) who had himself heard The Holy Prophet (PBUH) speak the particular words or seen him performing the action quoted in the Hadis.
(5)	The chain of narration from beginning to the end had un-interrupted continuity. 
Criterion adopted for judging the veracity of the Matn: 
a) It was not in conflict with the content, spirit, philosophy or the commandments of the Holy Quran in any manner or a tradition which had already stood the test of reliability / authenticity or the consensus (Ijma) of the community. 
b) It was not against the historical facts already established and proved. 
c) It was not against the dictates of reason, logic, rationale common sense or the laws of nature. 
d) It did not, in any way, hurl accusation at the family of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).

Qiyas
Qiyas or analogical deduction is the fourth source of Sharia for the Sunni jurisprudence. Shiites do not accept qiyas, but replace it with reason (aql). Qiyas is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Qiyas must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.
Supporters of qiyas will often point to passages in the Qur'an that describe an application of a similar process by past Islamic communities. According to Hadith, Muhammad said: "Where there is no revealed injunction, I will judge amongst you according to reason." Further, he extended the right to reason to others. Finally, qiyas is sanctioned by the ijma, or consensus, amongst Muhammad's companions.
The success and expansion of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, such as those of Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Ummayads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.
The general principle behind the process of qiyas is based on the understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.
The Hanafi school of thought very strongly supports qiyas. Imam Abu Hanifa, an important practitioner of qiyas, elevated qiyas to a position of great significance in Islamic law. Abu Hanifa extended the rigid principle of basing rulings on the Qur'an and Sunnah to incorporate opinion and exercise of free thought by jurists. In order to respond suitably to emerging problems, he based his judgments, like other jurists, on the explicit meanings of primary texts (the Qur'an and sunnah). But, he also considered the "spirit" of Islamic teachings, as well as the whether the ruling would be in the interest of the objectives of Islam. Such rulings were based on public interest and the welfare of the Muslim community.
“The knowledge of ours is an opinion, it is the best we have been able to achieve. He who is able to arrive at different conclusions is entitled to his own opinion as we are entitled to our own.” - Abu Hanifa
The Shafi'i school of thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, considered it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.
Imam Malik accepted qiyas as a valid source of legislation. For him, if a parallel could be established between the effective cause of a law in the primary sources and a new case, then analogical deduction could be viable tool. Malik, however, went beyond his adherence to "strict analogy" and proposed pronouncements on the basis of what jurists considered was "public good".
Ijtihad
Def
The Arabic word Ijtihad is derived from the ‘Juhud’ which means ‘expending of maximum effort in the performance of an act’. In Islamic jurisprudence Ijtihad means the effort made by the Mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the Ahkam (Rules) of the Sharia’ah through interpretation. (Nyazyee, Ch. 14: P. 263).
Scholars trained in various fields of Islamic discipline (jurisprudence, hadith, exegesis of Quran etc) were called mujtahids.
This definition implies the following:
That the Mujtahid should expend the maximum effort, that is, he should work to the limits of his ability so much so that he realize his inability to go any further.
That, the person expending the effort should be a Mujtahid. An effort expended by non-Mujtahid is of no consequence, because he is not qualified to do so.
Sources
The revealed sources are the Koran and the Sunnah forming the nass (nucleus/core) of the Sharia whereas qiyas and ijma are the non- revealed sources and are employed to derive law from the nass (plural, nusus) through the use of human reason and endeavour called ijtihad.
Role of Ijtihad in the development of Islamic legal theory
MAad ibn jabal story
At the time of the Holy Prophet (SAW) the only source of the Sharia’ah was revelation. That revelation had two types, one was the direct speech of Allah, namely the Holy Quran, and the other was indirect speech of Allah which the Holy Prophet (SAW) expressed in his own words, that is termed as Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (SAW).
The Holy Quran by nature is implicit. It does not provide details of each and every individual case, rather it describes general principles, examples etc. the Holy Prophet (SAW) used to explain and implement those principles and general rules in individual cases, that is Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (SAW), in that sense the Sunnah is the explanation of the Holy Quran, though as it is mentioned earlier that explanation was also directed by the God.
Although as it is mentioned earlier that the only source of law at that time was revelation, but some time the Holy Prophet (SAW) practiced Ijtihad in its narrow sense in the absence of reveled rule(s) as the Holy Prophet (SAW) said, ‘when I do not receive a revelation I adjudicate among you on the basis of my opinion’ (Abu Dawud, 1984:1017). However, the difference of that Ijtihad with ordinary Ijtihad bil ray is that whenever, He (SAW) mistook, a verse would be revealed in order to inform him the correct decision. For instance, once the Holy Prophet (SAW) was asked by a woman about the rule of dhihar. The Holy Prophet (SAW) answered her “I don’t think that the rule is different from that of divorce”. Then Allah revealed verses regarding the hukum of dhihar, which was not similar to divorce and then the hukum of dhihar had been corrected.
The companions of the prophet used to do Ijtihad at that time also. When the Prophet was not available or when the Prophet sent them to somewhere, they use to do Ijtihad in the absence of explicit Qur’anic verse or Sunnah of the Prophet. They use to interpret the verses of the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet as well as in cases of completely new issues they use to do Ijtihad on the basis of the principles of Sharia’ah. The advantage of them was if they mistook they could correct themselves by asking the Prophet or Allah would revealed the correct rule(s). Therefore, Sharia’ah was very much based on the revelation at that time, i.e. either Allah would reveal the hukum of a certain mas’ala or He would approve the decision(s) of the Prophet and his companions or He would disapproved and correct their decision(s). Hence, despite the fact that the practice of Ijtihad was started from that time, but it did not get the status of a source of Islamic legal theory then.
After the death of the Holy Prophet (SAW), the gate of revelation has been closed for ever. Therefore, in order to deal with new problems, the companions of the Holy Prophet (SAW) used to depend on the Ijtihad. However, it did not substitute the Holy Quran and Sunna at all, rather whenever they faced a new phenomenon regarding which they did not know any Qur’anic verse or Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (SAW), they used to ask the other companions whether they knew any Hadith of the Holy Prophet (SAW) concerning that. They used to do Ijtihad in the absence of the revealed rule and whenever they found any Hadith regarding that case they use to abandon their Ijtihad and followed that Hadith.

Ranks of Mujtahids and categories of Ijtihad
To make the matter simple we may say that both the Mujtahid and their Ijtihad are of three kinds.
Mujtahid mutlaq: This category is also known as Ijtihad fi'sh-Shar, absolute independence in legislation.18 The first four caliphs are considered to be in this category but it is principally the great masters of the four schools who are recognised as the Mujtahidun Mutlaq.
Mujtahid muntasib: A jurist who operates within each school following its methodology but producing new solutions for new legal cases. Such a jurist is also known as Mujtahid fi al-madhab. The work of a Mujtahid in this category is known as Ijtihad fil Madhab. Such a Mujtahid who is attached to one of the well-known schools and follows its juristic approach, may formulate his own independent legal opinions which may be different from the legal opinions of the founder. This degree has been granted to the immediate disciples of the great Imams who elaborated the systems of their Imams and added their own opinions. The most famous of these, for example in Hanafi fiqh, are the two disciples of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan.
Mujtahid muqallid: A jurist who merely follows the rulings arrived at by the mujtahids previously. However in issues in which he does not find an opinion of the founder, he exercises his own Ijtihad and issues a judgement. Such a Mujtahid must have a perfect knowledge of all the branches of jurisprudence according to the four schools and of the rulings that followed. His decision must always be in uniformity with the Mujtahadun of first and second classes and with the principles which guided them. Such an Ijtihad within the framework of the juristic and legal positions of a school is known as Ijtihad al-fatwa.
Neo ijtihadism
-	It was a regular practice and considered essential as Muslim societies evolved and faced new challenges between the seventh and 12th centuries.
-	In the 12th century, Sunnis decided that their four madhahib (Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafa’i and Maliki) were complete and the door on ijtihad was closed. Shia scholars have been continuously engaged in the process of rational reasoning and differ in the use of sources and process from Sunnis.
-	With the closure of ijtihad for most Sunnis, critical thinking, analysis of new issues and relevance of earlier religious decisions came almost to a stop.
-	From the 17th century on wards, discourses on Ijtihad versus Ijtihad taqlidi gained notable significance in Sunni Islam. Among the traditional reformers who argued to renew Ijtihad were Shah Wali Allah (d. 1765), Ibn Mu'mar (d. 1810), Muhammad ibn Ali al-Shawkani (d. 1832), and Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi (d. 1859). Their emphasis on the centrality of Ijtihad amounted to a criticism of taqlid. They maintained that taqlid "is lawful only when applied on behalf of laymen who need the guidance of legal scholars in running their mundane and religious affairs."26 They argued that for the learned jurists the ultimate authorities did not lie in the doctrines of past masters but rather in the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
-	Muslim scholars like Jamal al-Din Afghani (d. 1893) and his disciple Shaykh Muhammad Abduh27 (d. 1905) wrote about reopening of the door of Ijtihad. They claimed that to perceive the true essence of Islam one must free oneself from taqlid and blind dependence on the traditional interpretations of the four classical schools of thought and return to the religion of the forefathers (Salaf). 29It was argued that the Ijma of a few scholars to close the gate of Ijtihad was merely the result of fear of disunity among Muslims in a period of political instability and above all the decision was made in a period of 'intellectual stagnation' and now fresh Ijtihad is needed.
-	During the past decade a number of voices calling for a reformation of usul al-fiqh with a view toward fashioning a neo-ijtihad methodology have been raised. These include the Salafiah movement(s) which started in the 18-19th century. However, such movements and reformers still remain without methodological and philosophical foundations. Those who oppose neo Ijtihadism conclude that there 'only exists the process of Ijtihad which was employed by the Sahabah, Tabiun and Tab'Tabiun35 who solely depended on the exercise based on the Qur'an, Sunnah and the Conduct of the Prophet.'36 In their view it is not appropriate to throw away a thousand years of scholarship and reinvent the wheel.
-	Societies have changed drastically and it is essential that not only more scholars turn to both extensive and intensive effort to perform ijtihad, especially on issues that trouble Muslims, such as personal laws of marriage, divorce, inheritance, democracy and human freedom, inequity and injustice, but that they should do so in a deeply critical and disciplined manner, and with neutrality.
-	As Omid Safi writes, “a fundamental part of our struggle ... (jihad) to exorcise our inner demons and bring about justice in the world at large should be to engage in a progressive and critical interpretation of Islam (ijtihad)”.
Fiqh
Detailed law derived from the Qur’an and the Hadith covering the myriads of problems that arise in the course of man’s life have been compiled by some of the leading legislators of the past. The Muslims should forever be grateful to those men of learning and vision who devoted their lives to gaining a mastery of the Qur’an and the Hadith, and who made it easy for every Muslim to fashion his everyday affairs according to the requirements of the Shari’ah. It is due to them alone that Muslims all over the world can follow the Shari’ah easily even though their attainments in religion are never such that they could themselves give a correct and authentic interpretation of the Qur’an or the Hadith.
Tasawuf
Fiqh deals with observable conduct, the fulfiling of a duty to the letter. That concerning itself with the spirit of conduct is known as Tasawwuf. For example, when we say our prayers, Fiqh will judge us only by the fulfilment of the outward requirements such as ablution, facing towards the Ka’bah and the timing and the number of Rakaahs. Tasawwuf will judge our prayers by our concentration and devotion and by their effect on our morals and manners. An ‘Ibadah devoid of spirit, though correct in procedure, is like a man handsome in appearance but lacking in character and an ‘Ibadah full of spirit but defective in execution is like a man noble in character but deformed in appearance. The above example makes clear the relation between Fiqh and Tasawwuf. But it is to the misfortune of the Muslims that as they sank in knowledge and character with the passage of time, they also succumbed to the misguided philosophies of nations which were then dominant, partook of them and patched Islam with their perverted dogmas. They polluted the pure spring of Islamic Tasawwuf with absurdities that could not be justified by any stretch of the imagination on the basis of the Qur’an and the Hadith. Gradually a section of Muslims appeared who thought and proclaimed themselves immune to and above the requirements of the Shari’ah. These people are totally ignorant of Islam, for Islam cannot admit of Tasawwuf that takes liberties with the Shari’ah. No Sufi has the right to transgress the limits of the Shari’ah or treat lightly primary obligations (Fara’id) such as daily prayers, fasting, Zakah and the Hajj. Tasawwuf, in the true sense, is an intense love of Allah and Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) and such love requires a strict obedience to their commands as embodied in the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Prophet. Anyone who deviates from the divine commands makes a false claim of his love for Allah and His Apostle.
Justice in Islam
According to Al Raghib Al Isfahani, an 11th-century scholar of Quranic exegesis, the concept of justice in Islam is one that deals with both the quality of the soul and the quality of society. It is of three types: justice to God; justice to others and justice to oneself. The first is related to fulfilling the human’s commitment to God during the primordial phase; that of worshipping only Him and no one else. Justice towards God is also the direct consequence of being just to the self and to others.
Several words are used in the Quran for the idea of justice. According to Isfahani, justice to the self is ‘adl’and justice towards society is ‘qist’. ‘Adl’carries within it meanings of balance, as in generosity being the balance between being miserly and extravagant.
‘Qist’ means the adoption of principles of equity and equality in a socioeconomic sense. This is what constitutes social justice that makes for a righteous, moral and just society in which all humans are treated equally, regardless of wealth, social status, gender etc. Those who are disadvantaged or vulnerable in any way are treated in a manner that could, over time, bring them at par with others in a dignified way. Additionally, the Quran asks people to be just to other species and the environment.
The legal form of Islamic justice deals with all fairly, such that even if one’s closest relative commits a crime, one is bound morally to give evidence.
The third type is being fair and just to one’s inner self: making efforts to purify the soul from deceits, temptations, corruption and base desires. Indulging in a sin deliberately is doing an injustice (zulm) to oneself. If one is unjust to either oneself, and/or to others, this would be the same as doing an injustice to God. Also, being just to others and to oneself would be as if one was being just to God.
Building a just character within oneself is essential if one is to be just to others. Such a character would ensure that one subjects oneself to accountability against a strict moral scale in which being just to God, oneself and others is of prime importance. He or she would treat one’s neighbour, co-traveller, co-citizen and co-inhabitant of the same global system with consideration, kindness and compassion.
MISC.
Family system
-	Parity is the law of Allah[1] in all His creations as seen in, “And of all things We created two mates; perhaps you will remember.” (TMQ[2], 51:49). the wisdom of parity in all creatures to guarantee procreation and continuation of life till the time when Allah has set, with his wisdom, the end of all things.
-	“Mankind! We have created you from a male and female, and made you into peoples and tribes, so that you might come to know each other.
-	Linguistically the word family (usra) in Arabic is driven from the meanings of; unity, tight-ties, shielding and protecting. The word “family” indicates a group of people connected together through a tight tie that keeps them together and maintains their solidity. The Islamic concept of the family is; a group that emerges from a unity between a man and woman through a marriage contract, and the subsequent offspring that come from such a unity. Three dimensional; husband-wife; parent-child; siblings moukhzat
-	A whole chapter was revealed in the Qur’an for the purpose of addressing the family affairs; the chapter titled “Al-Talaq – Divorce”.
-	Prophetic guidelines came urging us to form families as in, “O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes the sexual desire.” (Al-Bukhary)
-	Gabriel (AS[5]) came with instantaneous solutions addressing family problems in the chapter titled “Al-Mujadalah – The Dispute”.
-	a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband’s house and is responsible for it.” (Al-Bukhary)
-	He who marries has completed half his religion, so let him fear Allah in the remaining half.”
-	Providing the community with a fit and good offspring. The Prophet (SAWS) says, “Marry the loving, child-bearing women for I shall have the largest numbers among the prophets on the day of Resurrection.” (Ahmad) So seeking the fit offspring is one of the fundamental objectives of marriage
-	Father/Husband responsibilities: Religious and Spiritual Prepping; Educational and Moral Prepping(“No wealth of a father for his child is better than courtesy.”) Fulfilling Financial Obligations or Commitments 
-	Wife: beautifying herself; obeying; Serving and Running Her House as a Favour not Obligation; A woman is compelled by her religion (and not bound by the law) to run the affairs of her house in matters related to; cooking, cleanliness, organizing, washing… etc. If she was brought up to be served by a servant then her husband is obliged to get her a servant.
-	Ibn-Qadama Al-Hanbalei said, “A woman is not obliged to server her husband in baking, cooking or otherwise.” (Related by Ahmad)
Fasad
Humans sin — by virtue of their nature. They can repent and may be forgiven, as promised by God. But those who commit sin in the most shameful ways and such that their sin can multiply and devastate groups and societies are the ones who cause fasad fil ardh. The word ‘fasad’ andits derivativeshave come 48 times in the Quran.
The sins that fall into the category of fasad fil ardh include intentional murder, rape and activities that deliberately target the lives, honour and property of ordinary people. Over the last several years, countries and regions that claim to possess a Quran- and Sunnah- based constitution are increasingly prone to these acts. Women and men are too often murdered for having married out of choice; a neighbouring country has seen brutal killing of men and women for not observing the most trivial orders of the self-proclaimed custodians of the Sharia; human rights activists have been executed without fair trial on the flimsiest of excuses.
Murders of Muslim and non-Muslim men and women on charges of blasphemy and marriage outside the community are too common. Sodomy and child sexual abuse even in seminaries is prevalent. Violence against women is rampant, both inside the home and in public life. The brutal murder of young women and a recent humiliation of another by hundreds of men would put the devil to shame. Condemnation of these horrific crimes by religious circles is rare. When it does happen, women are also blamed.
In themselves, these crimes speak to the impunity with which men consider women to be personal or collective male property, to be dispensed with as and when they see fit, after satisfying their base desires for sexual violence. They clearly fall under the fasad fil ardh category.
Police, courts, lawyers and judges are complicit in these crimes by delaying registration of the cases, bringing false witnesses and even after proof points to the accused, giving light sentences. The convicted are given facilities in prison and are freed after a short period, on the pretext of ‘good behaviour’. Within this ever-expanding group of persons involved in fasad fil ardh are also those who blame the victim for not being Islamic enough as well as those who spread the gory details, fake or otherwise, of these horrific crimes through the media. By carrying out these acts, people, knowingly or in ignorance, nurture an environment that is immune to the heinous nature of such vile deeds and take the onus away from the perpetrators.
Islam seeks to build peaceful, tranquil and serene societies in which life, honour and properties would be safe from harm. Muslims are creating ones that are aggressive and degrading for the marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable on the one hand and depraved and all powerful for the rich, political and supposedly religious class. The wrath of God will surely take its own course even as the world’s courts remain lax.

## Difference between Deen and Religion

- Religion is a mere set of Incantations, Rituals and Beliefs. Where as Deen is a way of life .
- Without Deen in politics it simply becomes a fight for gaining power with no end goal of Higher morality or purpose.
- **And whosoever adopts any other way except Islam that shall not 
be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he shall be among the 
losers.** - Al Quran 
- Allah Says deen with him is al-Islam.
  `https://www.alquranclasses.com/difference-between-deen-and-religion/`
    Religion  | Deen
    ------------- | -------------
    Private Matter  | Collective matter
    Attention of Religion is Huqooq Allah | Attention of Deen is Both  
    Religion is not political  | Deen guides in politics
    Religion has no opinion economic systems  | Deen in respect to islam has it own economic system
    Where as religion is only restricted to matters of rituals and customs | Complete way of Life
    Goes toward Spiritualism  |  Covers both spiritualism and Secularism
 
- **Secularism** the belief that the state, morals, education, etc., should  be  independent  of  religion.

  Islam has Quran the direct speech of Allah | Their scriptures are usually passed down for centuries whose veractiy cannot be validated.
  Strict adherence to Monotheism | Whereas in most other major religions other than judaism there is a pantheon of gods
  We have the whole life of Prophet Muhammad before us as an example to strive for | Where as in other religions information about leaders or prophets obscure and hard to verify(Jesus of Nazareth content about where nazareth is)
  In Islam direct connection with Allah | Religions such as christianity have a mediary in the form of pope and clergy between the people and God.
  Islam provides guidance in collective aspects of life such as Political system, Economic system and Rules of warfare | In other major religions such as christianity this is not he case.

## Sources of Shariah

### Ijtihad
`Source:`http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-compulsory-subjects/islamiat/islamiat-notes/15108-concept-ijtihad-islam.html 

- While defining Ijtihad Shatibi writes, “A process in which one exerts one’s efforts to one’s full capacity in order to acquire exact or probable knowledge or reach judgement in a given case.”
- The Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh), while sending Ma’ad Ibn Jabal to Yemen as its governor, is reported to have asked him as to how he would decide matters coming up before him. ‘I will judge matters according to the Book of Allah,’ said Ma’ad. But if the book of Allah contains nothing to guide you’ then I will act on the precedents of the Prophet of Allah. But if the precedent fails? “Then I will exert to form my own judgement”. The Prophet (Pbuh) approved his answers.
The Qur’anic verse ‘their affairs are (conducted) by mutual counsel’, was applied to its fullest extent by the Prophet (Pbuh) in his private and public life and was fully acted upon by the Caliphs.

- During the life of the Prophet, he got the divine message from God, and his life itself is an attempt to concretely apply what the text means. It is of course in a metaphorical sense. There was not much gap between the message and the meaning. When he died the question as to the meaning of texts arose. Each human being see things differently, so differences get resolved through discourse
- **Qiyas** extend the laws to new cases that may be similar to the cases mentioned in the sources for which the laws cannot be discovered through literal interpretation (this is called the method of analogy, or qiyas.
- **Istihsan** extend the laws to new cases that have not been covered by the previous two methods by looking at the general principles and objectives of the sharia (this method is known as istihsan
- The work of the interpreter of the text is to ascertain the authenticity of the source(s) and then discover the laws through the interpretation of the sources; Qiyas and Istihsan.
-  **Qualifications of a Mujtahid** 
  1. a competence in the Arabic language which allows him to have a correct understanding of the Qur’an
  2. an adequate knowledge of the Meccan and Medinese contents of the Qu'ran.Context
  3. an adequate knowledge of the sunnah
  4. 	he must practice what he preaches
  5. he should have a thorough knowledge of the the rules and procedures for reasoning by analogy
- **Closing Itihad** this decision has resulted in chronic intellectual stagnation, as thousands of potential mujtahids and scholars have been prohibited from offering workable solutions to newly emerging problems
- The first step toward opening the door of ijtihad, according to Qazwini, should be the liberation of religious establishments from the influence of political regimes because they are dependant on them financially.
- Reforming Muslim educational systems is also essential to contain all schools of though for a more inclusive understanding in a common muslim.
-  lack of freedom and democracy as serious impediments to ijtihad
-  Many issues facing Muslims today require ijtihad, and urgent attention can be: The role of women,Sunnis and Shiites, Economics,Muslims in non-Muslim countries.

4. Qualifications of a Mujtahid ?
5. What were the consequences of Closing the doors of Ijtihad ?

## Ijma and Qiya
`Source:`http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-compulsory-subjects/islamiat/75163-ijmaa-qiyas-outcome-ijtihad.html

- After carrying out Ijtihad when the jurists agree upon some way-out it becomes Ijmaa` or consensus of opinion. So basically Ijtihad is an exercise the net result of which may be either in the form of Ijmaa`/ consensus of opinion or Qiyaas/analogical deduction.
- For becoming a qualified jurist or mujtahids it is mandatory that one is well conversant with Arabic language and Islamic legal science, i.e. fiqh. In addition to it he/she must be having command upon the translation and exegesis of the Holy Quran and the ability to distinguish between authentic and non-authentic traditions. He must be fully aware of the methods of Qiyas or analogical deduction. He/she must be a person who is famous for piety and not the one who is notorious for his/her immoral activities
- the mujtahids or jurists have been divided into three categories, namely Mujtahideen fil-Shara, Mujtahideen fil Madhab and Mujtahideen fil-Massail. 
- On account of Ijtihad Islamic laws retains the capacity to develop and are free from stagnation. Ijtihad enables the Muslims to solve any complicated legal issue in the light of teachings of Islam that may arise at any moment of time. No doubt, there is great scope of Ijtihad in this modern age but two points are worth considering in this regard. Firstly, those issues which are clear in the Holy Quran and Sunnah or about which there is an absolute Ijmaa` do not come under the purview of Ijtihad. For example, Ijtihad cannot be made for exempting Muslims from Salat, Zakat, Fasting and Hajj or for permitting and legalising interest, drinking, obscenity lewdness, corruption etc. Secondly, people belonging to other professions who do not fulfil the requirements needed for becoming jurists have no authority to do Ijtihad. 
- After the demise of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) the election of the first Caliph of Muslims Hazrat Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was on the basis of Ijmaa`, when the absolute majority of companions of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) chose him as the first rightly-guided Caliph of Muslims. The Ijmaa` of one age can be repealed or modified by an Ijmaa` of any subsequent age with one exception that is the Ijmaa` of the companions of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) cannot be altered by the Ijmaa` of other ages. According to majority of Muslim scholars, at least three jurists are required for a valid Ijmaa`

- Qiyas or analogical deduction is the fourth source of Shariah that literally means to measure accord or equality. Those issues which have not been dealt with directly by the Holy Quran and Sunnah, nor determined by Ijmaa` or consensus of opinion may be resolved through Qiyas or analogical deduction. 
- Similarly, Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the talaq/divorce pronounced by an idiot and a mentally deranged person is not valid. Therefore, on account of analogy, it was declared that a talaq/divorce pronounced by a minor is also defective having no legal effect.
